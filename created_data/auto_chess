AutoChess,"I have just recently got into the game and wanted to test a few things and want it to go faster than other modes so I play Quick mode a lot. What I have noticed is that it seems like all I go up against are bots? Like they have decently unique names, state they are from different countries, mobile and PC etc. In quick mode, you don't gain interest at all so it is pointless to keep building up your coins, you need to just spend as soon as you can to get 3 stars fast. But I keep realizing that I am winning almost every game and I go to look at opponents and they have like 60 gold when they lose and don't distribute their items at all. I am account level 17 so I shouldn't be playing bots right?","Quick Mode, is it just bots?"

Link to short video below.

One of the big issues is there is no way that I can find to block this person. I can't click next to their name in my history to either add them as a friend or block them. Also why aren't there reporting options for bad behavior like this?

AutoChess,"I've been climbing ranks using only Hunter builds this season and figured out a solid strategy for Hunters!  It needs to win early, but that part's made easy by the build not buying non-frontline Hunters for the first handful of PvP rounds so it can grab whatever it can find to win early on.  These five points will help your Hunter builds do consistently well!

**1.) Take defense items, NOT defense pieces.**

Defense item auras are paramount for Hunters as they all want to be huddled together to do focused damage, to the point of pivoting builds if you find only two or fewer defense items among your first five.  Aura items are amazing for stacking Hunters, and so is evasion+HP for Umbra or valuable melee pieces.  No piece needs carry items because Hunters can collectively carry for most of the game.  However, every single piece on the board needs to be able to do good damage early on, preferably AoE if it's not a Hunter.  A 2* Taboo Witcher in particular is amazing for most of the game as mana burn makes it both an offense and defense piece, plus he can help activate Feathered synergy as well.

**2.) Pick the strongest early game pieces in order to snowball and to keep others from snowballing.**

Hunters don't require 3*'s for most of the game, and half of them aren't worth buying for the first eight rounds anyway.  The exceptions are Umbra, Skull Hunter and Wind Ranger as getting any two of them plus one more Hunter is strong enough to deploy early on.  While Egersis Ranger is cheap, it's better to 2* a cheesy melee piece first for early wins; however, never run Warrior synergy early on as they're too durdly and unreliable.  Taboo Witcher, melee Goblins, Skull Hunter + Swordman, duplicate Demons and a 2* Batrider+Witchdoctor are all great for early winstreaks.  Pandas are a little bit of a gamble but can pay off over time, plus a generated 2* Panda is worth keeping for most of or even an entire game.  Spirits aren't bad early on and neither are melee Mechs, but neither are worth long-term investments.

**3.) Invest in Druids, Glacier/Warlock or Cave midgame (assuming you aren't given Pandas or loads of 2* Hunters); also, get 2 Naga by lategame.**

All of these are pretty fantastic synergies alongside defense auras and Hunters.  2 Glacier+2 Warlock is sweet in general and gives your team room for a Venomancer or Shadow Devil, the Feathered Druids and 3* Unicorn are great cheap frontlines plus give Beast/Feathered synergy, and 4 Cave pairs well with resist auras plus Swordman's AoE also pairs well with Windranger for sweeping melee teams.  By level 9 you can fit any of these synergies in alongside 6 Hunters, and before you have 6 decent Hunters you can at least activate these synergies.  Consider 2* Source if you don't have 2* Fallen Witcher and/or the Egersis Hunters.  2 Naga is important for surviving lategame, no matter what else you're building.  Finally, while Dragon synergy can work well for some time it's better in the context of Knights and/or Egersis later on so it's a possible pivot point into either of those (consider Knights with an early 2* Knight as well).

**4.) Use leads to level up faster.**

You don't have to rush levels 8 or 9, but you can't delay them either.  10 can be delayed a bit, but once you find a strong legend piece or a second Naga you'll want to immediately level up and add it no matter what.  Level to 4-7 assertively as you should be winstreaking early on, or at least winning often.

**5.) Your best legendary items are defensive, not offensive.**

Really this is reiterating point #1 - defensive lego items alongside 2 Naga are what keep Hunters afloat lategame against 9 Mages, 9 Assassins, Mechs and everything in between.  Only when you have a 3* Hunter should you consider picking carry items; until then, prioritize defense items first and mana second, particularly for auras as they'll keep the team alive for as long as possible.  2* Spider is good to stack auras on as she has solid stats and is very useful so long as she is alive.  Put any vamp you're given on your hardest-hitting Hunter (often 2* Spider, Beast Hunter or Egersis) and protect them well.  As a side note, Teleport Dagger can work on a frontline piece - including Umbra and most demons and Caves - so long as they aren't the ones holding the auras!

**A couple extra tips using this strategy:**

- Keep Hunters close to the front, not in the back unless you have Dwarf synergy.

- The best solution as Hunters vs. AoE carries is being able to tank their first cast with items.  Cloud Halberd in particular counters Teleport Dagger shenanigans.

- Wind Ranger can do the most damage on a front corner tile, preferably with ability damage and mana items but always with another piece alongside him.",I think I've figured out how to climb consistently with Hunter builds! And it's actually pretty simple?

AutoChess,"Hi r/AutoChess! I‚Äôm back with results!

**TLDR**: You awesome people helped me out tremendously by participating in my PhD research on emotions in videogames, and it resulted in a [poster presentation](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.31096.78084) and a manuscript under revision at an academic journal. THANK YOU! If you‚Äôre interested, I have another survey that you can participate in [here](https://redcap.utoronto.ca/surveys/?s=WPN84ARJL9YE3C7C) for a chance to win a $20 gift card.

Over 2 pandemic-laden years ago, I asked people from this subreddit to participate in a study on gamers‚Äô emotional experiences, and I promised the mods that I‚Äôd be back with to tell you fine folks about the results. Because of the traction it got here, I was able to present some of my findings as a poster at the International Society of Sport Psychology (which I will summarize below, and [you can check out for yourself here](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.31096.78084)). A second reason I conducted this study was to validate an emotion-measuring survey in videogame contexts, and that paper is currently under review at an academic journal. Again, I can‚Äôt thank you enough!

As a general summary of the poster, I ran your open-ended descriptions of positive and negative in-game events through a sentiment analysis to see just how positive/negative you described those experiences to be. Keep in mind that these were descriptions of one-off events, so this analysis doesn‚Äôt tell us much about the frequency of positive or negative events throughout the average gameplay session. But still cool to look at!

I know AutoChess kind of blends a few gaming categories, but I would think that you Auto Chessmasters would tend to lump yourselves in with the sports/fighting games folks? Or maybe with strategy/cardgame folks? Anyway, in sports/fighting games, descriptions of positive experiences were characterized by words like ‚Äúwin‚Äù, ‚Äúrank‚Äù, and ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, whereas descriptions of negative experiences were characterized by words like ‚Äúlosing‚Äù, ‚Äúteam‚Äù, and ‚Äúopponent‚Äù. Compared to other genres, descriptions of negative experiences in sports/fighting games were found to be significantly less negative than MOBAs. 

In strategy/card games, descriptions of both positive and negative events tended to center around the word ‚Äúdeck‚Äù. Descriptions of positive experiences were characterized by words like ‚Äúwon‚Äù, ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù, and ‚Äúgood‚Äù, while descriptions of negative experiences were characterized by words like ‚Äúlost‚Äù, ‚Äúopponent‚Äù, and ‚Äúbad‚Äù. Compared to other genres, descriptions of negative events in strategy/card games were found to be significantly less negative than first/third-person shooters and MOBAs.

If you found this interesting, I‚Äôm running another study on the psychology of gamers at the moment. Like the last one, it‚Äôs a quick anonymous survey and participants will be entered in a draw to win 1 of 5 gift cards (of your choosing) valued at $20 CAD each! [Here‚Äôs the link to that](https://redcap.utoronto.ca/surveys/?s=WPN84ARJL9YE3C7C). And if anyone is interested around here, I can come back to report on those findings as well.",Results from a psychology study I conducted here a while back.

AutoChess,"What am I doing wrong?

I'm very new to this game and aside from some early wins in the lowest ranks, I'm getting demolished recently.

I usually can end up getting 4th-2nd, but I feel like it's just a crapshoot.

When it gets down to 4 or so players, my team just gets annihilated by my opponents and I lose like 20 health per turn till I'm dead.  In my last 20 or so games I don't have any wins, but I've been climbing slowly because I manage to squeak out a 3rd or something.

I'm trying all different types of teams.  Sometimes I'll get an early 2* unit and cruise through the first 10 rounds.  Other times I have a slower build and I take early losses but end up with a strong team at the end.

I am trying to build teams around synergies that my opponents aren't going for but I rarely get that special comp that just ""works"".

Lately I've found myself just settling for Goblin/Mech or some beast lineup, but when I'm in the later rounds I get nuked in like 10 seconds by a guy with 4+ 3* synergized units.

I've looked on YouTube for some tips but most of them seem to be pretty old, so I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

AutoChess,"I started playing the game mid season 12.

I'm curious to how the path of development has been. How many times characters were removed and returned, how many items removed and returned, how have synergies and abilities been altered, cosmetic changes, audio changes. Through 3 seasons i have seen this game change a lot and fairly frequently.

AutoChess,,Shining Archer is the Key to Playing Feathered!
AutoChess,"To give some perspective I'm currently ranked at Rook 2. I prefer to either run mech based builds or spirits and they seem work pretty well for me. I watch videos from time to time but recently I've noticed how everyone is running fallen with glacial (Witcher being the star of the show) and just molly whopping everything in sight. I tried it a few games and forced the build more than I should have. For anyone to be able to pick up a Witcher in like round 15 and ride one stars for a third of the game and waste coins and still finish top 4 is ridiculous. 
I'm curious if you all think this piece is overpowered? Because forcing builds is in my humble opinion not how you should be playing at rook or beyond. If I'm able to force fallen glacial and climb ranks without even thinking about a solid strategy I think we can agree it needs a nerf. I know there's other viable builds that can beat it but it seems if you have lucky rolls early it's a complete dumpster fire to go against. What's y'all's take?",Fallen Witcher busted?

2. The skins - I am saving up the pink candies to buy some skins , can you guys suggest which  skins are the best?

3. The money- I know its free to play but I saw some screenshots and there is some currency written in the gold column.

4. The builds- What are some good builds right now , when I play , I usually build Eregeis-hunter , goblin-warlock , 9 Assassians , 9 warriors. I know eregies-hunter is no.1 rn.

And now after trying it since season 2, while it has some little flaws (like in the recommended line-ups tab 'Summoners' is mentioned twice lol) it has been so much fun. Aside from the increased in-app purchases offers (which I totally support and understand)  the game has improved IMO. Much more chill now, alot of gamemodes and events, new updates, I'm really happy to see this game still going. And I for sure recommend it for anyone looking for a video game to chillax and have a good time.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally my favorite thing about this game is collecting illustrations in casual games (I have accumulated a bunch of 3-star epics) and sometimes reading their biography. So I was wondering, is there no need to sell all of my stuff and lose the game (in casual of course) to collect my illustration? Can you just enter a custom game with your friends and get them all? It would suck if you can actually do it. If someone can answer this question I'd appreciate it &lt;3",Impressions of a returning player (I used to play in season 2) and a question...

AutoChess,"It's been a few times now that i've gone 3 Wizard, 1 Pandaren and didn't get a single pull for 10+ rounds. Sometimes for even longer. It seems to be that the probabilities are not really based on numbers but rather whether or not the game deems you ""worthy"" to receive drops. Because in games where pandaren will pull, it does so extremely, and when it won't it simply doesn't do anything.

AutoChess,"Most of you likely didn't play this game when it was still a DOTA mod, but since it's inception, goblin/mechs have *always* just flat-decided the early game.

But, in the beginning, mechs died off *much, much* faster; what you see today, with two or three different people successfully playing them
into the midgame? Impossible, in the beginning. But then they added wizards, and civets, and in my three years of playing this game, minus two six-month hiati due to frustration (pandas launch, blech), this comp has never really taken a breather.

How is the community not bored to death of *both* playing and losing to this brainless comp? The only turns that involve any strategy are like the last three; it is competitive against every comp, and dominates most. It has almost always been this way.

Me, I actively lose MMR avoiding playing them. Indeed, I actively lose MMR for *every* game in which I play something interesting. Because you can‚Äîyou can dominate a lobby until the very end with almost anything and simply *playing well*.  Which means you can walk away with at least fourth and not *have* to play one of whichever two comps + mechs/goblins are currently favored.

I don't see much criticism of Drodo, the game, or in particular this years-old thorn in the side of the game. But I just *can't believe* I'm alone in wishing I didn't have to tech every comp I'm building against mechs to pull a podium position.

Composition seems to matter less than it ever has; it feels like a race to five drops, now? That, and somehow mechs seem to have gotten stronger (I figured they'd taper off by rook but it hasn't seemed like it).

I am taking a lot of second and third place positions after completely dominating a lobby behind just plain ole' two-star midnight spirit or that elf shaman, whatever it's called.

Basically it.

Closest genre would likely be an autoplay game - autobattler. It's on free on PC.

A few decent mobile games I've played:

Pokemon Masters seems ok. It's 3v3 where you controls all the units. There doesn't seem to be anything else like that.

Teppen also seems ok.  It's like minion monsters only that you're limited to 3 units instead of limitless. It's suppose to be alot more complex but haven't seen that yet. You cannot place units specific places on the field",Has there been any better game like Minion Masters? Why is it better?

Hi everyone! I've got a new meta post for you, and just in time for the start of the in-game championship! You can find my last Meta Post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/o2otzw/20210618_meta_builds/)

There are a lot of playable builds in this meta so I'll keep the introduction short and get right into it. Just 3 things before we get started:

&amp;#x200B;

* This is more of a meta overview and less of a build guide. It's meant to give you a look at what you can do and what you might be facing. I have made the images to give you a quick overview of positioning and possible tech choices (on top) so they can be understood at a quick glance. This time I've also included a short list of core units since it was brought to my attention that newer players don't know all the unit icons. [Game Wiki](https://ac.dragonest.com/en/charactor)

&amp;#x200B;

* This is not meant to be an in-depth build guide on every step of playing a build. Should there be a lot of interest about a specific build I'll consider making one. I'll try to answer any questions you have in the comments

&amp;#x200B;

* There's only 2 tiers. The top tier are the builds that are very Strong, Popular and Consistent right now, and the viable Builds that can compete with these top builds, but maybe aren't as consistent.

So now that everybody's confused, lets go on to the builds:

# Top Tier

**Divine:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Divine Shaman](https://preview.redd.it/is07if1qksg71.jpg?width=462&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1459654fca1e4c64de43d8efb50220c6858a893b)

&amp;#x200B;

[Divine Warlock](https://preview.redd.it/vnsl349sksg71.jpg?width=465&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df7c57e17663a77bc4b2f57fe92e154f5432d132)

*Core Units Shaman: God of War, Godess of Light, Grand Herald, Soul Devourer, Water Spirit/Argali Knight, Lava Shaman, Storm Shaman, Sunchaser Shaman, Doom*

*Core Units Warlock: God of War, Godess of Light, Grand Herald, Grimtouch, Swordsman, Desperate Doctor, Soul Reaper, Venomancer*

Divine is still the most consistent build to get top 3 in my opinion, strong from both winstreak and losestreak. Easy to transition into from almost anything else. If you can 2 star your Legendary, you can win. Shamans I think are easier to play and more forgiving in terms of mistakes or bad items, but Warlock is stronger at lvl 8 and very powerful in the endgame with 2\* Dark Spirit  3\* Swordsman. Warlock is probably the most mana hungry build out there and it can be difficult to fit in a Source, switching around items and positioning to get the best possible board will be necessary.

The image for Div Shamans shows Argali Knight as Carry, but atm Water Spirit is probably better. Use Argali if you're against Knights. Aim for Legendary Carry in the endgame (best would be Phantom Queen)

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Feathered**

&amp;#x200B;

[9 Feathered](https://preview.redd.it/3w0i6m7uksg71.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba17886bc041c998550259d384d59d29b59d00d6)

*Core Units: Warpwood Sage, Shining Archer, Shining Assassin, Grand Herald, Soul Devourer, Grimtouch, Doom, Source*

Very strong against physical damage builds, vulnerable to magic damage. Already a good build and has been buffed in the last patch. Best played from the Hunter winning streak, can deal 30+ damage to the enemy player in the midgame. Also great if you like playing with Grim Combo, as Grim + Shining Archer will be a big part of your power and Grim + Doom can cripple many opponents. You can even add another 2\* Grimtouch if you want (and if you can get it). Easy transition to 9 Mage if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Feathered Assassins**

&amp;#x200B;

[Feathered Assassins](https://preview.redd.it/jsorjv8xksg71.jpg?width=455&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc55a733bee6cb784eb8e7668d3910add5b5cd4b)

*Core Units: Shadow Crawler, Abyssal Crawler, Warpwood Sage, Witcher, Shining Assassin, Feathered Archer, Whisper Seer, Siren*

Just a very solid build, easy to enter from the losing streak. There's actually a great build guide [here](https://pooonur.com/how-to-play-wings-assassins-english/) , so check it out if you want. 3-costs have become harder to find with the addition of Gem artisan, so you might need to focus on abyssal crawler 3\*. Build Monkey King Cane if against 9 Feathered.

&amp;#x200B;

**6 Mech**

&amp;#x200B;

[6 Mech](https://preview.redd.it/98xhosxzksg71.jpg?width=468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4eb6686e397a3c08d881884ec82032cbb3a0df2)

*Core Units: Soul Breaker, Sky Breaker, Heaven Bomber, Ripper, Venomancer, Devastator, Grimtouch, Grand Herald, Gem Artisan*

Not my favorite build but its certainly popular. If you get a good collection of mechs early and there are Dev and Heli in the legendary pool, you can go for it. Don't be afraid to drop 6 Goblins for more Legendaries on board. Utilize Gem Artisans race ability to duplicate strong pieces and gain an advantage early to midgame. you can also hedge you bets with a combination of Mech and Divine (Ripper, Heaven Bomber and Artisan) and then move to whichever you get better rolls for.

&amp;#x200B;

# Competitive Tier

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Mage**

&amp;#x200B;

[9 Mage](https://preview.redd.it/ozz1r7y1lsg71.jpg?width=469&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51d8f2ad4b78e7f8f9b0723550b7d9b112942d3b)

*Core Units: Thuder Spirit, Tortolla Elder, Source, Swordsman, Grand Herald, Soul Devourer, Grimtouch, Poison Dragon*

Less popular atm because there are less Beasts to prey on and its weak to Shamans, but its a strong build that can be very useful against Goblins and Feathered. Really wants to find that Ice Armor in Round 30.

&amp;#x200B;

**Beasts**

&amp;#x200B;

[6 Beasts](https://preview.redd.it/bi2r4a44lsg71.jpg?width=478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5804d1202cd2810616db33889adfe5202d92a1cc)

*Core Units: Unicorn, Razorclaw, Sand King, Werewolf, Poisonous Worm, Tusk, Monkey King, Desperate Doctor, Sacred Lancer (Fortune Teller), Doom/Fallen Witcher*

Beasts got nerfed a bit, but its still very good if it comes together well. Fallen Witcher and Rogue Guard both got buffed, so consider them as carries as well. 2\* Monkey King is still super strong if you can get it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Horn Shaman Mage**

&amp;#x200B;

[Horn Shaman](https://preview.redd.it/y954myq5lsg71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6706879825a46f5a816e6e51824b7dc26863b9de)

*Core Units: Thuder Spirit, Tortolla Elder, Source, Lava Shaman, Storm Shaman, Sunchaser Shaman, Scryer, Sunchaser Assassin*

Fun and very synergistic build. Mage works well with Shamans and Source will give your transformed units the mana they need. Also has an opening for 3 Humans.

Credit to [pooonur.com](https://pooonur.com), I first learned about this build from [this guide](https://pooonur.com/s12-horn-shaman-mage/) (japanese)

&amp;#x200B;

**6 Humans / 5 Dragon lvl 12**

&amp;#x200B;

[6 Human Endgame](https://preview.redd.it/e3a2iqf7lsg71.jpg?width=462&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48f6164a0b2d4347e085b0432cd1135f59276ad)

*Core Units: Dragon Knight, Frostblaze Dragon, Winter Chiroptean, Poison Dragon, Grimtouch, Grand Herald, Tortolla Elder*

Winstreak with 3 mech -&gt; 3 mech 3 human -&gt; 6 human. If you can get to lvl 12 and still have some money and health, you will have a devastating endgame build that can adapt to any opponent. The image shows 5 dragon 6 mage 4 Div 4 Spirit, but you should adapt that to whatever the situation requires. Getting there is difficult, and navigating all your options and the positioning can be tricky, but this is the strongest build when completed.

&amp;#x200B;

**6 Knights**

&amp;#x200B;

[6 Knights](https://preview.redd.it/r2pzfww9lsg71.jpg?width=467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88720ae416c59aa75bf2c2a357edcf225484d102)

*Core Units: Undead Knight, Demon Knight, Argali Knight, Avenge Knight, Dragon Knight (Lightblade Knight), Desperate Doctor, Soul Reaper, Frost Knight*

Same as last time: Still good if you can get a lot of stacks on your Avenge and get it 3\* in a reasonable timeframe. Not the most amazing endgame, but very intuitive and beginner friendly.

&amp;#x200B;

**6 Glacier**

&amp;#x200B;

[6 Glacier](https://preview.redd.it/t6vcthzblsg71.jpg?width=464&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6305d0b731a4c90050995db193e071dce6b38c35)

*Core Units: Doom, Warpwood Sage, Grimtouch, Defector, Desperate Doctor, Grand Herald, Soul Devourer, Shadow Crawler (Abby Crawler/Lightblade Knight)*

Cool build with fun Grim Combos, desperately wants a 3\* Carry. Switch to 5 Glacier + 2 Wizards when you find Sacred Lancer

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Hunters**

&amp;#x200B;

[9 Hunter](https://preview.redd.it/41g3pkcdlsg71.jpg?width=469&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af8803c228993f69be2c33553491d9233c92d4fc)

*Core Units: Tsunami Stalker, Cave Hunter, Spider Queen, Siren, Wind Ranger, Egersis Ranger, Shining Archer, Umbra, Dwarf Sniper*

If you're winstreaking with hunters and you find the Tsunami Stalker, might as well go for this solid choice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Cool build with fun Grim Combos, desperately needs a 3\* Carry. Switch to 5 Glacier + 2 Wizards when you find Sacred Lancer

&amp;#x200B;

**9 Hunters** 

&amp;#x200B;

[9 Hunters](https://preview.redd.it/uyvnhcbx6sg71.jpg?width=469&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f5524a9ac52ebc9d86419d138a99e8c13cb66c)

If you're winstreaking with hunters and you find the Tsunami Stalker, might as well go for this solid choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's it for my meta post, there are a lot of options in this meta, so find some builds you enjoy and go for it! if you have any questions feel free to post a comment. 

If you want, you can also check out  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/owu1r0/guide_ranked_essentials_round_counting_and_lose/) I wrote about lose streaking and round counting to improve your game.

Good luck in your matches!

AutoChess,"Hey everyone,
someone asked for rook-9 advice on discord and I wrote a somewhat lengthy response. I figured maybe some more people could get some use out of this advice, so I'll just post it here as well:

""Ok so the first big thing is to start round counting if you aren't already, so you know which opponents you will face and take your opportunities to steal a winstreak. Connected to that, work on your awareness/game sense/whatever you want to call it, basically be aware of what your opponents are doing, what builds they are going for, who is doing well and will give you trouble, do you need python/oblivion, who will you face in the endgame etc...

Between rounds 4-11 you will cycle through all opponents and won't face an opponent twice. So if you remember/mark down who you have already faced, you can be sure who you will face R11, R9 it's between 2 players, R8 it's between 3 etc. Then the cycle restarts R12-19 you will face every player again and so on

Notably, the cycle resets whenever 2 players get knocked out, but that's a problem for the endgame
At least in the first two cycles, you should always be aware of who you have faced already. So for example, if it's R17 and there is a big winstreaker you haven't fought yet, take a look at their board. See if you can maybe reposition or roll a bit to win and take their streak
R11 and R19 you know exactly who you fight so be ready for them
Doing this will give you a huge advantage over people who don't, and will give you a fighting chance against those who do
There's a couple of ways to do it comfortably: you can just write down the opponents names, if you're on mobile you can actually use the little mute buttons to signify who you've faced, on pc/ps you could also snap a quick pic of the opponents with your phone, then make little marks on that pic. That's just some ideas to make it easier, if you can just remember, even better

About lose streak/open fort: winning streak is of course always preferable, but that won't be possible every game. So of its round 4 or 5 and your board isn't looking so great, it might be time to go for a losing streak. If you've gotten one of the priests, you're golden. This makes Goddess of Light a high priority unit early on, she can help with both winning and losing. If you decide on losing, really lean into it and sell everything non essential to reach the next interest point (10, 20 etc)

Losing streak will give you a lot of free time since you don't need to focus on your board. Use this time to utilize the skills I mentioned before. Have a look at your opponents. Do your opponents have summoners (Druid, werewolf, umbra, skull hunter)? If so, just putting out a priest will actually be less damage than putting out more units. If not, you can try mitigate some damage by having a bit of a board but still losing. Again, use your powers of future sight to make sure you don't accidentally overpower someone with a weak board. Just putting priest is definitely the safer, more auto-pilot option

If you've been lose streaking from the start, R16 you will be around 50 health, probably lvl 7 with a bunch of money. Now is the time to stop losing (with Knights you might want to start earlier, like on 11/12). Level up depending on your build and start rolling. Stop once you've put out a respectable board. Hopefully you can start winning from here, get your economy back up, and eventually win the game.""

Hopefully you will find some of this information useful, feel free to ask questions in the comments.",[Guide] Ranked Essentials: Round counting and lose streak

AutoChess,,[Drodo] New Unit Lineup Review
AutoChess,"There is an issue where the cursor tends to select certain units when you try to navigate the chessboard.

For example, when I'm moving along empty spaces on the chessboard with the left analog stick, the game will erroneously select certain units on my board, as if I had selected them with the X button. I noticed that this tends to occur when I'm around level 8 and above. It is seriously disruptive but I couldn't find another player on reddit who is facing this issue. As this occurs during late game, it is extremely disruptive and has caused me to lose several games when synergies such as 6Goblins are required to gain an upper hand.

AutoChess,"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't had a meta post like this in a while, so I thought I'd try my hand at making one.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm certainly not the best player out there by any means, nor is this a pro level Guide or anything. When I started playing posts like these really helped me out since there isn't really a build hub for this game and patches change this game a lot, so information tends to go out of date pretty quickly. So hopefully some people out there will find some of this useful. I also believe that a more widespread knowledge of the meta in general improves the meta itself, thus making a better game experience for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/frzm1lqgb0671.jpg?width=2400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0448c29b862e0384d75860ec3e1ac07154fa2c2

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I've added some thoughts to the builds, but this is not meant to be a build guide. One that would make this post even longer and two I haven't played every build enough to make a guide on it. This is more meant as a resource to see whats possible or refresh your memory. Also, don't take any of this set in stone, neither the units, nor the items or the positioning. And certainly not my estimation or their relative strength. All of this is subject to change depending on many factors. Be flexible and think on your feet!

&amp;#x200B;

Enough prelude, on to the builds:

&amp;#x200B;

**Tier 1** (Imo)

&amp;#x200B;

Beast 6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t4j9e7d5c0671.jpg?width=478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f43624abc3253099c26cac59e57bae1f0f14d39e

Carry options: Spacewalker, Rogue Guard, Lancer, Doom, Venomancer Kira, Fallen Witcher

Items: depends, the melee carries really want shadow edge. Python Wand is very much recommended. Blink Dagger is useful. Lancer wants Frantic Mask (from here on ""Mask"") and Holy Spirit Lance (from here on ""Splitter""). Barbaric Cuirass is a great endgame choice in general.

Currently a popular choice. Already a contender before the heavy Divinity/Shaman nerfs, the Beasts are strong and come with a variety of carry choices. With the new Limited Legendary Rule 5-Costs have  realistic carry potential, and Beasts gets to choose from a couple very good ones. As a whole, staying at lvl 8 to 3 star your carry has very much gone out of style across the board, and its advantageous to invest in higher level to find powerful 4 and 5 stars. Fallen can still be good midgame if you get him 2\*, but don't get too attached.

&amp;#x200B;

9 Mage

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b0ewvwaoe0671.jpg?width=460&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85f8b996688ee322f67b149c3113362c2fe11b71

Forgot to include Sacred Lancer and Poison Dragon as options

Items: Pulse Wand, Python Wand, Voodoo Staff, Ice Armor, Blink for Grim

9 Mage is back. I haven't played it a lot, but is certainly powerful when played right. Has many build options and can easily be 9 Feathered or 6 Glacier if needed. Don't attempt with zero mana items.

&amp;#x200B;

Divine Shaman:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sy1419w7p0671.jpg?width=462&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e629833a2d900d0f75e22da2835a036ed9c49f1

Items: Blink &gt; Pulse Wand imho, Penguin Sickle, Refresher Orb, Ice Armor, Python Wand

Feeling the nerfs to both Divine and Shaman, but still workable. What I love most about this build is how many options for carry and defense it has. Really wants high level to find 5-Cost Carries. Weaker if Phantom Queen and Zeus aren't in the pool. Pay attention to what your opponents are playing when deciding what board to put out.

&amp;#x200B;

Feathered Assassin

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/90zpdm1uq0671.jpg?width=455&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad00d11701cf589bf09f5bc73a933110a5ca1fc0

Items: Mask, Shadow Edge, Python Wand, Cuirass

One of the most consistently strong builds, though item dependent. I really like it, especially from a loss streak. Needs 3 Star Crawlers, ideally both. Really going to feel it if you're playing this build contested by 2 or more other players.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tier 2**

&amp;#x200B;

Knights

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n4qo4wt8s0671.jpg?width=467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02f5d132318253a24cf561c8fe79b98e40cf924c

Items: Mask, Shadow Edge, Cuirass

Still good if you can get your Avenge 3\* in a reasonable timeframe. Not the most amazing endgame, but very intuitive and beginner friendly.

&amp;#x200B;

6 Egersis

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a9isb0e6t0671.jpg?width=464&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2760beec113f9b5c9d4c1c80326fa884330682

Items: Thunder Hammer (early winstreak), Splitter, Mask (when using Sniper, only use upgraded Mask for DK), Ice Armor, really any damage item

A viable option especially from the hunter Winstreak, carry can be Dragon Knight or 3\* Sniper.

&amp;#x200B;

6 Human

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sbb6wlsut0671.jpg?width=466&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0117d19c9fdaec1a9e5db9bc2f4a4469f3c856a

Items: Pulse Wand, Voodoo Staff, anything to help you win rounds

If you get to level 12 with health still intact, you will be very hard to beat. If you fail you'll probably be one of the first to go. Requires flexible use of Mages, Dragons, Knights and anything else you can get your hands on to win and get those sweet sweet books of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Cave Horn Shaman

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3q8h82dgv0671.jpg?width=485&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3c9b8533a5b6ed35d4e60c75c880f253510fc95

Still experimental build with many variations, basically Beast but Defensive. Natural home to Lucky Pandas imo.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats it from me, thank you to all the content creators and helpful community members who helped me improve at this game!

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully people will find this helpful, I'd be happy for some feedback.

**TL;DR - for experienced players**

Lose streak into Divinity/Shaman + Water Spirit or into Feathered Sins depending on your items.

&amp;#x200B;

**intro**

We will talk about 2 builds here. For a beginner it is better to know how to play 2 builds perfectly and force them, rather than playing what the game gives you. There are many other very strong builds (6 beasts, insect, divinity mage, 6 knights, 6 humans...). But let's concentrate on the following for now:

1) Divinity + Shaman + Water Spirit - Level 8

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xv9v87yefgy61.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4082a2c6b57142ba866c1c90956c933faaf50fb5

2) Feather Sins - Level 7

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qmijzy6ofgy61.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab3f054b5633e6a9ceec711048cdafbec1bf7138

**how do I decide what build to play**

Your items are just as important as the pieces you find in the shop. The 2 main items we will be looking for are:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ricuxjcvggy61.png?width=295&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8599c463449c85d6964d07c64916178839b64741

For the purpose of this guide I will oversimplify it and say that if you find a Crystal after the first 3 rounds, we will play build **1** and if there is no Crystal but (ideally) more than 1 Club, we will force build **2.** If you don't find any of these items after the first 3 rounds, just force build **1** for now and hope for a Crystal in Round 10 and 15. The next thing you will want to do after you decide your build is to:

&amp;#x200B;

**lose streak**

Especially in lower ranked lobbies it is almost always a get idea to lose streak. The easiest way to do it for a beginner is just to open fort (no pieces on the board except for a Priest + maybe Panda). Just be patient, build your eco and take the pieces from the shop that you want for your build. You want to lose streak till round 12-15 depending on your health and the pieces you have. Scout the lobby and see if there is any other player trying to lose streak and try to make sure to not lose your lose streak to them.

&amp;#x200B;

**build number 1**

*Lose streak* your way to R10 and do not level up. Not levelling will give you a better chance to find Water Spirit in the shop (35 % for a 2-cost unit on Level 5 vs 30% on Level 6). You will probably want to roll a bit before the Creeps on R10 to 2-star your units to make sure that you beat the creeps. If you are not lucky to 2-star your pieces, just buy any pieces you need from the shop to beat the creeps and sell them afterwards.

*Items* you will be looking for, for your Water Spirit are: Teleport Dagger, Python Wand, Voodoo Staff, Orb of Regen, Cloud of Halberd. Do not place any items on your Shamans, they are ignored after you reach the 4-Shaman synergy. Also, be patient with your items. Since you are lose streaking, you do not need to commit to your items right away. Sometimes it is a better move to wait if maybe the Broken Sword you need for the Teleport Dagger drops from Creeps rather taking it over (for example) a Magicka Staff in the shop.

*The* p*osition* of your pieces is important. A few things to keep in mind: 

\- if you try to steal somebody's win streak, position your Grand Herald so that you steal the pieces you that benefits you the most

\- try to avoid teleporting your Water Spirit into a Taboo Witcher

\- do not let other people's Grand Herald steal your Water Spirit (you usually do not want your Water Spirit to be positioned in the corner of the board as that is where most people place their Grand Heralds for some reason)

*Levelling up* is a hard thing to explain as it largely depends on the pieces you find in your shop. A few points to help you out: 

\- if possible, you want to  avoid levelling up to 6 before you 2-star your Water Spirit

\- you should be able to steal win streaks once you end your lose streak (rounds 13-25)

\- once you reach Level 8, you want to roll for Storm Shaman if you still don't have him; 4-Shaman synergy is very strong especially before round 25.

\- after you reach Level 8 with a 4-Shaman synergy, you usually want to either A) chill, eco up and slowly level to L9 B) 3-star your Water Spirit if you are close to it; on L9 you want to add Phantom Queen if possible. if you don't have Phantom Queen, think about adding another Shaman.

\- after you reach L9, you want to 3-star your Water Spirit before leveling to 10

*End gam*e is, again, hard to explain is it largely depends on your opponent. A few points:

\- pay attention to the position of your and your opponent's Grand Herald

\- Equip your Phantom Queen with good items and if you manage to 2-star it, consider making her your main carry over the Water Spirit

\- For advanced players - sometimes it might be the right move the give up your Shaman synergy and switch into 4 spirits or Marine.

**As you can see, this build is pretty strong even if you force it in Queen lobby and I am by far not the best end-game player:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7k2vs6vutgy61.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=968bba67296dcc1e6867b276afbb980a225e1793

**build number 2**

Let me know if you want me to describe the second build in a similar manner and what you want to know.

&amp;#x200B;

**end**

Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything you are missing. There are a lot of small things that I have not mentioned here and that you can see more experienced players do pretty much automatically such as: not using their eggs right away when trying to 3-star a piece, re-positioning for the creeps, buying the pieces other players want in the end-game and so on...

Also, if you don't agree with anything, let me know as well. I will be happy to discuss it and learn something new :)

Feel free to follow me or ask anything

Most other games have 3 kinds of currencies:

* One representing real money
* One representing in-game time (you receive it the more you play)
* One representing in-game progress (you receive it the better you play or the higher you advance)

Now... these are the currencies Auto Chess has:

* Donuts: they represent real money
* Candies: they basically represent time spent playing
* Cookies: you get them from selling duplicates
* Cakes/marshmallows/lollypops/...: you get them from events to buy things at event stores
* Chess Skin Fragments: to buy chess skins, you get them from the chess pass or during random events
* Chess Player Fragments: to buy players, you get them... from events only? (dunno)
* Chessboard Fragments: to buy chessboards... don't know how you get them
* Fine Jigsaw: to buy things in the fragment store, don't know how you get them
* Chess Pass Points: you get them daily or from missions, they advance your pass level
* Pass Voucher: to buy things in the Exchange Store inside the Chess Pass

Did they really need to add fragments? And the worst of it, none of the currencies represent progress in terms of how well you do!!

This player had a piece, God of war, 3-star around 17k HP.

He didn't have Cave Synergy, nor any items on the piece, still, the piece had around 17k HP, see screenshots. The player came 1st, named: **Ajosi**

Not sure how this is possible, if so please shed some light on this.

&amp;#x200B;

For more details please read below.......

I first noticed something is off when I kept losing to a player all of a sudden, for some reason I was never able to kill some 1 of his pieces even though I should.

In the next round with the same player, I clicked on the surviving piece, and what I see, over 14k max HP on 2-star Soul Reaper... I lost... 

The next time, I saw God of war, 3-star over 15k max HP, I was confused as to what synergy/items can cause a piece to have such huge HP, I checked he didn't have Cave-Synergy.

next game again God of War had almost 17k HP, this time I took a screenshot (attached), Please check the GOD of war, 3-star, no items, not sure how can it have 17k max HP.... the unit won't die at all...

by the last rounds, I saw he was able to distribute this HP Hack on other units, the god of war was around 10k HP, and Dark Spirit, 2-star, was around 6k HP... won't units won't die.. I will lose badly

Not sure how is it possible, please shed some light on this.

- install pocket dragonest app

- go to tools and select recommended lineupi
- press the + button and add your recommended lineup
- you need to enter a short description to be able to post it
- done! You should now be able to select your lineup in-game under ""my lineups""

I wanted to know if theres cheaters? Just lost to a dude with 4 tier 5 units at lvl 3? (Helicopter, Granny, Devastator and Dark Spirit). His value was 225 almost triple of mine by round 42, so its not mega late game either.

AutoChess,,"Right after I bought Hall of Judgement from the store, I got this from Silver Donut box..."
AutoChess,"So I know for sure that if I get Panda assassin, I will win the match in first place, no doubt. The unit is just so OP and doesn't have any real counters from the enemy side.

However, too many times I have had my absolute useless heaven brew unit on the board from round 3, all the way to round 35, and from apparently being the most unpopular panda who has ever existed, fails to invite any pieces whatsoever to the board way into round 30. Building around that brew works out, but it just feels incredibly unfun that there is a 50% chance in every game the race effect just doesn't appear at all.

Getting storm brew is OK, because it increases the chance to get the assassin brew, but in my games at least, winning through panda can go from position 7 to 1 all due to pure RNG.

Go ahead and nerf the pandas, works for me. Remove added damage to assassin ability too. However I propose to please add pseudo-randomness to the panda race effect, meaning the chance to get a drop increases when no drops are received. It should not be possible to go through 20 rounds with no drops.
Waiting even 30 rounds for something that just doesn't happen is just no fun at all.","Panda is OP and all, but.."

And B counters C, but C needs basically 4 3-stars to be more powerful, so in this case the counter of B over C is much stronger, leading to more HP for you and pressure on your opponents to roll to upgrade.

There is more rng involved with this synergy than any other in the game and that is what balances it. The only reason it seems OP is because everyone is playing it.

AutoChess,[removed],A few general questions.
AutoChess,"Hey, last season was my first full season. I made it up to Rook 7 but I as I got higher it became a real grind, obviously.  A few questions that may be common knowledge to others but maybe could help me push forward.

1) Is the pool of chess pieces defined? Are the X amount of a certain piece in each game. Is the composition of the chess pool different each game? Or is it random? 

1a) When a player is defeated, are those pieces returned to the chess pool? For Instance, If I am playing Knights and another player is playing knights. Should I expect to see more knights if that players is eliminated?

2) I really like Abyssal Crawler. But assassins seems to be general garbage. Can anyone recommend a lineup that involves Abyssal Crawler that can actually win? 

3) This one seems obvious but i'd throw it in. For Unique Passives, that's just per chess piece right? If i have a Shadow Edge, it won't double Proc on the same character but it will proc on two characters? If so, is that a desired situation. To have say a Doom Arbiter and a Swordman with a cleave each in the middle of the board? 

4) Is Doom Arbiter the best main carry for Warriors? I sometimes feel I should make A Holy Spirit lance for a Bersker and then switch his gear to Sacred Lancer if I get that far.

5) Is there an updated site with Meta guides that someone can point me towards. I search a lot on google but I either get results from about a year ago or in different languages. Is there a best english language site that keeps everything updated?

1) Is the pool of chess pieces defined? Are the X amount of a certain piece in each game. Is the composition of the chess pool different each game? Or is it random? 

1a) When a player is defeated, are those pieces returned to the chess pool? For Instance, If I am playing Knights and another player is playing knights. Should I expect to see more knights if that players is eliminated?

2) I really like Abyssal Crawler. But assassins seems to be general garbage. Can anyone recommend a lineup that involves Abyssal Crawler that can actually win? 

3) This one seems obvious but i'd throw it in. For Unique Passives, that's just per chess piece right? If i have a Shadow Edge, it won't double Proc on the same character but it will proc on two characters? If so, is that a desired situation. To have say a Doom Arbiter and a Swordman with a cleave each in the middle of the board? 

4) Is Doom Arbiter the best main carry for Warriors? I sometimes feel I should make A Holy Spirit lance for a Bersker and then switch his gear to Sacred Lancer if I get that far.

5) Is there an updated site with Meta guides that someone can point me towards. I search a lot on google but I either get results from about a year ago or in different languages. Is there a best english language site that keeps everything updated?

Full disclosure, I hate the rng-generated minions mechanic, but who cares, I'm just one dude on the internet. My problem is that the unique ""reset cd on kill"" mechanic that ember blade and zappy boi share make them oppressively strong.



Pandas already create a unique economy advantage if you're lucky enough to hit all three- the fact that ember blade can be slotted into ANY comp and be the best carry in the game BY FAR has thrown the meta completely out of whack. You don't even have to roll for it, the stupid thing 3*s itself! 


The pandas race mechanic, no matter how dumb and high-rolly I personally find it, has opened up a lot of weird, fun comps. All that needs to change, imo, to keep them from being so oppressive, is to remove that stupid ult reset so highrolling into a 3* ember doesn't automatically win you the game (with the obligatory ""unless someone has also highrolled shamans early"" caveat).

AutoChess,"Hello Everyone,

I am new to this game (&lt;10 games total) and in this genre. 

I feel like I'm gradually improving. My first few matches I finished last. Then, I finished top 6. Then, I finished top 4. And now, in my last back to back games, I finished top 2. 

I feel like in those two 1v1 situations that my opponents countered my build.  I just couldn't get one win even though I had a decent health advantage. I know there are late game builds in this game but I guess I am not good enough to notice if these are the ones that beat.

I just really confused with what to do during the end game. By mid game, my team synergy is getting into good form already. But by late/end game, I don't know what else to do if I can't get the units I need to complete my team.

Do I just keep refreshing the shop? Do I hold out and take the hits? Do I completely switch my build to something else?

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",End Game Tips?

So how can this build be countered? Are there positionings or pieces that help counter this from my two builds? I'm capable of being flexible if I see someone starting with the build early, I do check my opponents throughout the match.

The game for me right now is crashing pretty hard, when I try to load it up, it goes straight into a game, and then crashes. Love this game, it would be even more fun if I could play it. 

Side note: the only other problem I have right now with the console version, is when I use the adjust positions (L1+X) it should only adjust the pieces on the board. It shouldn't be swapping pieces from the bench with pieces I have on the board, unless I have an open slot, and it added a piece from the bench to fill in, that's different. It always grabs a clone piece and messes up my synergy. Absolutely annoying.","So I just got this game on console, and it is crashing. Anyone else having this problem?"

AutoChess,There‚Äôs five locked or greyed out characters and I wanted to see if anyone knows why that is?,Why can‚Äôt I use certain characters on mobile?
AutoChess,"If you want to climb the ladder force:

-6 egersis ranger, or 6 egersis knights. Probably the best build right now with Dragon Knight carry.

-shaman variants- either shaman divinity with water spirit carry, or cave/shaman/glacier with berserker or lancer carry. Shaman is just so good right now because if the enemy carry kills a shaman it‚Äôll turn it into a different unit almost impossible to counter.

-9 warrior, pretty consistent doom arbiter carry.


Builds to avoid:

Feathered. Unless you are high-rolling Sage and other feathered units, seriously avoid. Relies heavily on RNG for grimtouch + dwarf and shining archer combo. Most cases your grimtouch will die endgame before even gets ult, and shining archer and dwarf both hit random targets with their ult and if they don‚Äôt combo with grim you‚Äôre screwed. Assassin variant is even worse.

Assassins- they just suck rn.

Mage- if the enemy builds python wand on their carry you insta lose. Especially with how popular knights are, their magical resistance means you won‚Äôt blow them up quick enough.",Builds to play &amp; builds to avoid

I originally played Dota AutoChess as the mod when it came out, getting 400 hours of gameplay on that, and then a ton of gameplay on mobile when it came out months later before leaving the game for a while. I'm trying to come back now and I'm wondering if I should focus on the mod or on the stand alone game? Which is played more and is there any advantage to either?",Standalone or Dota Mod?

AutoChess,"So after two hours of chatting with a supervisor through PSN we found a fix this fix causes no harm or headache apart from resubmitting a connection and set up like you would if you just bought your ps4.

Go to settings &gt; initialization &gt; restore default settings &gt; enter your code if needed and click restore.

System will auto reset.

Do opening set up and reset your connections.

Once done go to your library and search for the game from the actual search bar. Open autochess from here. Download. And boom.... it actually downloads and doesn't throw an error.

AutoChess,"I got the game yesterday, but the tutorial was incredibly laggy, and I couldn't quite understand much of how to play. Pretty much the only thing I understood was that you buy characters and you should aim to make them have the same type/class or something (which admittedly isn't very much lol).

AutoChess,"Hi guys. When I started playing autochess again recently, I really could not find a good video for beginner. Luckily, I am not exactly a beginner (I was queen back in Dota autochess era).

From the limited materials that I found online, most of them are about OP combos. I want to diverge from this and talk more about the techniques that you need to master in order to win.

I made a beginner guide. If you are a beginner, I hope that helps. I know the video quality is poor, but I love the game and I hope more people can find autochess enjoyable.

Please let me know if you like/dislike the video. I want to create materials for new players so they do not feel like the game is hard to play

AutoChess,,"That‚Äôs what Auto Chess is all about. One day you give your opponent a lesson, the next day he gives you one"
AutoChess,"I never realised how it is important to choose right items for your composition in early game.

In early game it feels you need to do not specific synergy but try to be as strong as possible. And you also need to get right items for that synergy which game forces you in early game.

You can have a little better composition  then your opponent but if he has right items and you not- you take 15 damage.

In my opinion defensive items are very weak atm and you should ignore all of them. You need only one tanky unit without items and a lot of damage in early game. 

Also best lategame compositions are good in early game too. And it makes it a lot easier to get top3 and you do not need to transition to insectoids.",Early game: items + doing everything

AutoChess,"This morning I had an interesting match where the last 3 players standing ended up being:

1) Me: 6 feathered + 6 hunters, only 3 star units being Druid ones, many defensive items but not many offensive ones

2) 9 Warriors

3) 6 Mages

What happened for many turns was that I would destroy the mage build, lose to the 9W (in very close matches) and then the 9W would lose to 6 Mages.  Eventually the match ended with the 6 Mages player getting knocked out by my ghost, and while I was stuck with 2 star units the 9W player found 3 star Berzerker and some more stuff. I spent 60+ gold looking for the last Egersis Ranger but failed to do so.

Regardless of item rng and reroll rng, when a late game match ends up in a situation like this one, how do people approach it? Do you just embrace the top3 and wait for the rng Gods to do as they please? Try to find some units that can be better against the build that is destroying you without giving up too much against the one you're defeating? Pray that your nemesis gets knocked out by your prey or your prey's ghost?

The game really needs to maybe... Remove some knights? Or perhaps change their race/class to something else. 

Trust me if u force knight most of the time you will be on top 3, its a braindead build that is too easy, especially if you play avenge knight and have w bit of luck w it. 

Imagine this you are on a winning streak preventing the avenge knight from getting her damage but  there will always be other players feeding the knight from start to finish and you will endup losing.

My idea for avenge knight
- Make her damage increase to only the player that he or she defeated. Example , player A loses against avenge knight hence the next time he/she face against that particular avenge knight she will have +damage. But this will only work against the player A, whereas for other players maybe the avenge knight will only have half of it.

AutoChess,"**What is the total number of each class of pieces in the piece pool?**

2020-10-13 02:08:40

There are 36 pieces worth 1 gold, 27 pieces of 2 gold, 23 pieces of 3 gold, 14 pieces of 4 gold and 10 pieces of 5 gold.

**What is the refreshing possibility of Strange Egg?**

2020-10-13 02:24:15

3/1000.

**How is the armor being calculated?**

2020-10-13 01:57:48

Damage alleviation by armor = 0.052 x armor value / (0.9+0.048 x armor value).

For example, armor increase from item is 10, from buff is 5, hence the sum of damage alleviation would be (0.052*15)/(0.9+0.048*15) = 48%

Please add '-' when armor is negative. 


**How is magical resistance being calculated?**


2020-10-13 01:58:59

Damage alleviation by magical resistance = 1-((1-magical resistance from items)x(1-magical resistance from buff)), when the latter resistance is minus, please add a '-' before it.

For example, magical resistance from items is 15%, from buff is 40%, hence the sum of damage alleviation would be 1-[(1-0.15)x(1-0.4)] = 49%.


**How to calculate the mana regeneration of pieces?**

2020-10-13 02:00:14

2.5 damage = 1 mana. Mages, warlocks, priest and shamans have a limit of 20 for mana regeneration in one single attack, other races have the limit of 10. This limit could be increased by equipping items which enhance mana regeneration.


**How is the attack speed being calculated? Is there a limit of it?** 

2020-10-13 02:01:21

The final attack rate = basic attack rate/(1+the sum of attack speed increase - the sum of attack speed decrease), the limit is 1/7 of the basic attack rate.


**Why there are some differences in the movement of the same piece? (e.g. use the same piece to against creeps in the first round, the route will be different.)**

2020-10-13 02:02:30

Because at the beginning of the battle, there are random start-up delays for each piece, and the delays are all different according to the practical positions of the pieces, which will result in different routes of different pieces calculated by the system which is the shortest one.


**What would happen to my items if I have two identical pieces full of items being synthesized into a higher level?**

2020-10-13 02:07:26

Items will return to the inventory randomly.


**What is the mechanism of fatigue damage?**

2020-10-13 02:27:23

In the battle, when there are only two players left, the Fatigue mechanism will take effect after 4 more rounds (but no later than the Round 50), and the calculation of the losing HP is adjusted from rounding up to rounding down. For example: If you remain 3 HP, then the Fatigue will deduct 1 HP (instead of 2)


**What are the refreshing possiblities of the hidden piece(Hell knight and SOul repear)? How much are they?**

2020-10-13 02:25:26

3/100,000,000.

Corruption Soul reaper: 10 gold

Reaper's Scythe: Kills an enemy piece instantly without any area of effects.

Ashes Hell Knight: 15 gold

Helling Phantasm: Summons 3 phantasmal copies to battle.


**Why is the piece with the highest attack not being disarmed when I have equipped the Cloud Halberd?**

2020-10-13 02:05:50

Because during the determination of disarming, if the piece with the highest attack is just in its movement, it will elude the determination.",Useful information for King - Queen players!

AutoChess,"I've been testing out some hard pivots in the late game to increase my chances of winning against counters. Some of the pivots are still too difficult due to lack of gold/ bench room.

Example of a moderate pivot in the late game: 5 dragons 6 mages &gt; 5 dragons 4 ergesis 2 knights. 
Drop tort/source/thunder spirit for dev/evil knight/(siren, dark spirit, tsunami)

It's good versus a stacked glacial knights player who will smoke mages in 2 seconds.

One idea I have for a hard transition in the late game is Insectoids transitioning into 4 Cave, 4 Warlock, 4 Shaman, 4 Glacial to deal with 4 spirit mages 4 spirit sins.

https://i.redd.it/fhhor7tyr9v51.png

It seems difficult to pull off since there is only 1 connecting unit between the two builds but it is very easy to roll the high cost units by late game. Idea is basically sell all the insects to fully commit to the hard pivot when the legendary shamans show up in the shop much like in the mid game transition into insectoids where you sell all units to roll/place insects on the board.

If you have ideas for hard pivots post below.",Hard pivots in the late game

AutoChess,,Getting DC'ed once in a while now. And the game doesn't reconnects me anymore. Caption.
AutoChess,"Unless you won donuts from the championship and used that to buy the chess pass, it would be wise not to buy the chess pass this season.

-The doubling of cubes is just a marketing tactic. They nerfed the gacha tickets you get from 60 to 10 so the number of cubes you get from lvl 1 to 80 is roughly the same.
-The odds are much worse in this chess pass. Instead of getting a guaranteed skin, you only have a 9% chance of getting the skins. As for the gacha tickets you have a 4/7 chance of ""losing"" and 1/7 chance of breaking even and 2/7 chance of ""winning"".
-There is a possible outcome where you can ""WIN"" in this chess pass, and that is buying the cubes and getting 100/80 gacha tickets, getting a surplus of 40/20 each time. Odds are astronomically against you though.
-You're not getting the 3500 gacha tickets chessboard with a regular chess pass. Only way is through buying levels.
-They moved the free skins you get from the free chess pass into the senior chess pass chest, as you can see from the Thunder Spirit and Soul Devourer skins in there. Sucks for F2P users since there is no incentive to log in every day as you can get to level 71 easily by just completing the quests.",This season's chess pass is a rip off

AutoChess,"Longtime player.

And I'm really fed up with the dishonesty taking place with the lootbox chances, which to me is basically scamming - or fraud.  Let's take a recent one for example, summer lucky chest.  

0.10%  Legendary (1 Chessboard)

19.9%  Epic  (4 Unit skin rolls- 2 permanent, 2 temporary \[crap\])

80%     Common  (Crap)

An important thing to note is there's the Rare rarity, which is NOT being implemented here.  And that the game would have you believe that it's simply a coin-flip between getting the permanent skin and the useless temp vers, with equal chance.  Now, I realised prettyyy early on in the game that it was quite clearly weighted heavily in favour of distributing the temporary versions, regardless of the sign.  I'm sure a lot of you have temporary chess boards clogging your inventory - 9 myself.  Haven't won any actual ones, of course.  And that 'lucky' chest?  I personally rolled 16 temporary skins, and not 1 regular.   

Between 2 valuable epic prizes and two epic disappointments, basically a coin flip: I lost that 16 times in a row.  Taken as 2 values, ""good"" and ""bad"", losing that 16 times should occur roughly 1.5 times in a million.  I seek to call attention to this shifty behaviour, and that they simply reclassify the temp items as Rares, and list the actual values.  Temporary skins can be moved to rare.  Or deleted entirely, I've never used a temp item once myself, pure candy fodder.   Support swears until blue in the face that I'm unlucky, that it's fair as displayed.  I can only snort in derisement that they'd think anyone's that gullible.  Well, time to take a stand on it?

And don't give me ""RNG"".  Croupier, player, gamer.  I know odds.

AutoChess,"With 7 [units](https://old.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/hhrnj2/dev_log_plan_of_new_chess_piece_for_future/) coming into the chess pool within a year, I think blacklisting is necessary in the game. 

Right now rolling down at 5 is really bad with the number of two cost pieces in the pool. Pool went from 14 pieces to 16 pieces (17 pieces with the addition of SD). Some strategies like Glacial Knights are still very niche and require high rolling for it to function properly, especially when up against Warriors where you want to push for levels to get synergies and units up.

So a suggestion on how to fix this is to add a mechanic where you can permanently blacklist two (3 when SD is released) 2 cost units starting from Round 11. This allows rolling down at 5 to be a viable strategy again. If Drodo wants to add more 2 cost pieces, just add one more unit to the list.

The other problem is legendaries where it is very difficult to find your units due to the addition of Sacred Lancer. So starting from Round 26, allow a player to blacklist ONE legendary unit to keep the pool like it was at the start of Season 6.

Item RNG is the last problem I'll be addressing in this post. Item luck can play a big part in how the last few fights turn out. Sometimes your opponents gets his Infused/HSL/Icearmor while you have a bunch of worthless Tier 1 item junk, doesn't matter what you run, you lose because of dumb RNG. So to somewhat balance it out make ROUND 30 creeps only drop TIER 2 items (Nether Essence, DBA, Wraith Shard, Mysterial Staff, etc.) and the item choices you get should also only be TIER 2. This way everyone knows when they can expect their build to start taking off. Round 35 and up should stay the same as sometimes you need the early item components you had to give up for a blink, pulse, maelstrom.",Add blacklisting and guaranteed drops

AutoChess,"**About Soul Devourer:**

After we released the information on our new chess piece Soul Devourer, we have received plenty of feedback from all players. There was one point that everyone wondering about: Why does Soul Devourer cost only 1 gold?

In your feedback, we picked up a lot of clear thoughts. For instance, with a new chess piece, the God - Water Sprit meta will be more powerful and hard to counter. Of course, we love to see that all players are expressing their own thoughts. As developers, we are taking the comments made by each player seriously, and combining the reasons stated by everyone along with our original intention of setting it as a 1 gold chess piece, we concluded that some adjustments should be made.

In addition, we have conducted a large number of tests internally on Soul Devourer with 1 gold and 2 gold respectively. Through the final data performance, we found that in the current game, setting it as a 2 gold chess piece can ensure the balance of the game at the largest degree.

Hence, our new chess piece Soul Devourer will cost 2 gold instead of 1 when it comes out on the formal server. 

**About Wizard (4):**

At the same time, a lot of players are asking that whether we are going to update the Wizard Synergy (4) or whether we are going to remove one of the Wizard chess pieces temporarily? 

The answer is that we are going to update the Wizard Synergy (4) in the new version.

Effect of Wizard (4): 1 less chess piece is required for activating synergy with at least 4 unique chess pieces; if there's only the synergy of one race/class is activated other than the Wizard synergy, then the highest tier of this synergy will be activated immediately.",Adjustment: Soul Devourer &amp; Wizard Synergy

AutoChess,"There are 3 solid counters to insectoids in this meta right now. They are Glacial Knights, Cave Glacial Shaman and 4 Beast 2 Witcher 6 Warriors.

You want to run Glacial Knights only if its open lane,  have frantic mask components, and you get a fast 2* Hell Knight or 2* Lightblade before round 10. You can lose streak into it and roll for the knights after the creep round when you have 50 gold at Lvl 5. You can also win streak with it if you high roll your glacials or knights. Once you get 8 try to get Ergesis Warlock into the build for the two bonuses. Once you get 9 get Shaman Bonus. Once you get 10 get Dark Spirit and stack items on him.

Positioning should be putting all the units in the backlines like assassins so the insects occupy the middle area where they will be in DS's Black Hole.

Most of the insects have very low armor so Lightblade can clean through them easily, especially with Holy Spirit Lance. Even better if you have Halberd,  you can kill Venomancer before he can do 1000 dmg to your team.

Cave Glacial Shaman is straight forward. You can do 4 Cave 4 Shaman 4 Warlock to grief his Venomancer. Position two shamans in the back if he has blink. Position them in the front if he doesn't.

4 Beast 2 Witcher 6 Warriors is a build you want to go into from 9 Warriors, if insectoids is becoming a problem. Basically you want to use the demon buff to clean through the insects as 9 Warriors loses a lot of its use after round 30 when enemies start getting good items. Stack Doom 2 or Rogue Guard 2 if you can get it. If you can get Doom 3 you can probably close the game out pretty easily as insectoids has a hard time going into Spirits.

Build should be (Tusk Champion, Werewolf, Worm, Sand King) (Fallen Witcher, Taboo Witcher) (Rogue Guard, Doom, Abyssal, Pirate Captain/Ghost Kid/Swordsman)",Counters to Insectoids

In a recent major update, we‚Äôve added the Shaman (4) synergy into the game. Due to the strength of this synergy, we received a lot of feedback from players that said that almost everyone in the game is now using shaman.

However, we didn't rush making the adjustments, because we still had to repeatedly test the changes in the internal beta environment to make sure that the changes wouldn‚Äôt produce new problems.

By analyzing the data from all of the matches and referring to the situation in Dota Auto Chess, we decide to take the following steps, which will be premiered in our experimental server.

&amp;#x200B;

**What‚Äôs the change?**

The main problem with the 4 Shaman synergy is that the hexed chess piece might turn into something completely useless, from something that once played a very important role in the lineup. So, in order to avoid this awkwardness, we have come out with the following solution:

&gt;The chess piece hexed by 4 Shaman will inherit the HP status and all the equipped Items (along with the CD time) and get full mana.

&amp;#x200B;

This solution is parallel to the treatment in the Dota2 Auto Chess. After the adjustment, 4 Shaman is expected to be effectively weakened, and you will have more chances to counter the Shaman lineups.

&amp;#x200B;

**A ‚Äúlittle bug‚Äù in this change**

At this time, the balance adjustment is directly done on the backstage, so in the battle, you might still find the Items of your hexed pieces are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù, but in fact, they will still be inherited. This problem will be resolved accordingly in the next client update.

* **Cave Glacier Shaman** (Last Week: 1st)

*Units: Red Axe, Swordsman, Skull Hunter, Lava Shaman, Storm Shaman, Grimtouch, Grand Herald, Defector, Desperate Doctor, Sacred Lancer/Berzerker.*

[ \(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days\) ](https://preview.redd.it/k7drqodpcyf51.png?width=371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0ec056511f03f5b5b56520b274dc64053ccd95)

Cave-Glacier-Shamans still on top and by an incredibly far margin. The top three most popular compositions are all variants of this core build. The stats show that, when complete, this build is one of the most consistent builds in the current meta with great utility from the (4) Shaman synergy while also being a hyper carry comp utilizing either Berzerker or Sacred Lancer, one of the strongest carry units in the game. With the (6) Cave synergy, they're also durable enough to withstand mages. The biggest risk of running this comp seems to be being contested. Regardless these are some of the most dominant stats we've seen throughout the history of metas.   

&amp;#x200B;

* **Dragon-Mages** (Last Week: 2nd)

*Units: Winter Chiro, Venom, Dragon Knight, Frostblaze Dragon, Tortola Elder, Flaming Wizard, God of Thunder, Grand Herald, Grimtouch, Storm Shaman.*

 (Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days) 

Mages stay second on these power rankings. Although the frequency is relatively low at 2.3k, the reward for successfully executing this build is high with a 3.2 average placing and 21.1% win rate for it's most popular variant. Failing to execute this build; however, is incredibly punishing with two variants placing an average higher than 6th! Learning this build and unlocking it's true potential is definitely a must in the *Red Meta. O*ther than Cave-Glacier-Shamans themselves, dragon-mages are, perhaps, the best equipped at countering Cave-Glacier-Shaman with their high burst damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Beast** (Last Week: 3rd)

*Units: Unicorn, Tusk Champion, Poisonous Worm, Lord of Sand, Werewolf, Razor Claw, Ogre Mage, Venomancer + duplicate/Dark Spirit).*

6-Beasts is the 4th most popular unique composition with a 3.3k frequency. 6-beast is still a viable build in the current meta. A 4.3 average placing isn't too bad. The difference between it's preceding variants is that the most popular version is now the Kira version! With this version, you're able to utilize duplicate carries if you're able to reach the late game and obtain two 2-Venomancers. If you're able to get this activated, this is perhaps one of the few remaining builds that can match well against the meta and actually claim Top 1 as indicated by its decent 19.3% win rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **9-Warrior** (Last Week: Honorable Mentions)  

 *Units: Tusk Champion, Red Axe Chief, Abyssal Guard, Swordsman, Werewolf, Ghost Kid, Pirate Captain, Berzerker, Doom Arbiter/Rogue Guard + Flex Unit (Siren, Devastator, or Dark Spirit)*

9-warriors are the second most popular core build with a frequency of 4.5k; quite a distance from the most popular build, Cave-Glacier-Shaman. 9-warriors are incredibly balanced and, thus, match up relatively well against Cave-Glacier-Shamans. They're also very flexible, able to add marines, Dark Spirit, and other flex units. The flexibility to seamlessly add (2) marines make them match up well against Dragon-mages as well. 

Running 9-warriors, you can now utilize Sacred Lancer as a viable range carry. One variant can include activating the (2) Glacier bonus with Berzerker to fully maximize using Sacred Lancer as a carry. Overall, 9-warriors is one of the easier builds to play and, when mastered can be incredibly strong. However, ultimately, the ceiling isn't too high for them: 4.7 average placing and only a measly 5.2% win rate. Oof! Not looking too great from a build that dominated the first half of Season 6. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Feathered Hunters** (Last Week: 4th)

*Units: Dwarf Sniper, Shining Archer, Wind Ranger, Warpwood Sage, Whisper Seer, Taboo Witcher, Shining Assassin + Flex units (Fallen Witcher, Siren, Scryer, Grimtouch, etc.)*

 (Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days) 

Moving down one spot are feathered hunters. This build is able to exploit the weaknesses of the Cave-Glacier-Shaman and Dragon-Mage dominant metas by being the most compatible with hunters and, thus, the easiest build to use to dominate the early game and transition into. This build is good pushing the pace of the lobby and forcing others to make rash decisions or mistakes. Utilizing summons is especially important as you want to deal as much damage as possible. Having two 2-cost carry-able units in Dwarf Sniper and Shining Archer as well as being a decently balanced composition with Warpwood Sage also being able to hold on its own, Feathered Hunters doesn't do too bad in this meta. The ceiling (i.e. getting top 1) is fairly low, however, with only a 13.3% win rate. On the other hand, and average placing of 3.7 is quite decent (better than warriors and Beast-Kira). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Honorable Mentions**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Goblins**

Also one of the builds that finish top 1 in my personal experience. However, it seems as though the player base is reluctant to try it out. Regardless, Goblin-Warlock-Kira and other variants including the Demon variant if you're able to high roll a Fallen Witcher, is one of the more balanced compositions in the game. The mech synergy also makes it possible to easily dominate the early game and set you up nicely for the remaining stages of the game. If you're able to 3-star your supplementary Goblins, you may be able to clinch a win even against Shamans. For now, however, this build remains on honorable mentions. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Dragon** **Knights**

Dragon Knights are also well-balanced and they do decent against mages. This is another build that the player base has yet to explore too much; however, results from other players have shown that this could be one of those 'hidden' meta builds.","Weekly Meta Power Rankings (Week 8, Season 6)"

AutoChess,"Review of '*Red Meta*'  

Following the addition of three units: Lava Shaman, Skull Hunter, and Sacred Lancer, we've witnessed the rise of a build that seamlessly includes the three new units. The [(6) Cave (4) Glacier (4) Shaman]() build has dominated the meta; hence, the theme of the meta being the *Red Meta*. The most effective counter is (5) Dragon (6) Mages, and they too are one of the more popular builds. For other builds to work around the meta, they must exploit the weaknesses of the Cave-Glacier-Shaman build and Dragon-Mages. Thus, common exploitable themes that have emerged in the current meta are:
1. **Pace is slower**; specifically around the mid-game (Round 17-21). For an ""off-meta"" build to exploit this, they must have a significant power spike between these rounds.  
2. **Don't run Hyper Carries**. Hyper carries are completely nullified due to the (4) Shaman synergy. To exploit this, compositions need to be more balanced all throughout or carry units that needs to be split or duplicated.  
 
I'll be updating the [Season 6 Cheat Sheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/hth6kw/season_6_cheat_sheets_compilation/) based on these prerequisites.

**Feathered Hunters**  
Overall Grade: B+  
Effectiveness: B  
Feasibility: A-   

[Cheat Sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/hwzixb/feathered_hunters_cheat_sheet_for_s6/)  
[In-depth Guide](http://zzbweb-abroad.dragonest.com/share/?fbclid=IwAR3Ec9L_x0VUx2tvIKMtoKm9gaXjUG3Euw8hgj4O1Lwq3trgIjKSa_HBn_I#/shareArticle?id=b82eb3564d5&amp;language=en_US)  
[Sample](https://imgur.com/a/r7tcTmY)  

Feathered Hunters are now tier B+ instead of A. They've fallen into particular 'niche' again, in that, they are an early to mid-game powerhouse; but vulnerable in the late-game when their win-conditions are very far. Nonetheless, the playstyle remains unchanged:  
1. Run (3) hunters early or even (6) hunters paired with strong early game units and synergies.  
2. Level fast depending on the pace of the lobby. You want to be Level 7 by Round 13 or 17 at the latest.  
3. At Round 17-19, you will want to roll moderately (20-30 gold) looking for 2*/3* Warpwood Sage, 2* hunters, any other conditions to make sure you're able to streak at Round 21--the ability to determine this is at the user's discretion.  
4. By Round 21+, you will want to have (6) Feathered Activated with (3) Hunters and fully upgraded Druids. Look for legendaries and 3* hunters afterward.  

Notes:  

1. It is now a MUST to streak early and long (5+). The objective is very clear and demanding for this build and that is to push the pace of the lobby and force your opponents out of rhythm or out of the game. In the sample provided, the Cave-Shaman-players were all forced out early.  
2. If you're far away from your mid-game conditions (i.e. 3* Druids), then you have the option to opt into a build with easier late game conditions. If you aren't able to take advantage of the mid-game, don't run this build.  
3. **Spilt your carries** between Dwarf Sniper and Shining Archer. Ideally 3 items each. From there, focus on mana items for your flex unit (i.e. Dark Spirit).

**6-Beast + Fallen Witcher**  
Overall Grade: A-  
Effectiveness: A  
Feasibility: A-  

[Cheat Sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/hj5645/season_6_cheatsheet_to_beasts/)   
[In-depth Guide] (TBA)   
[Sample](https://imgur.com/a/1HvPxGF)  

6-beasts hasn't fallen too far, although, before the update, 6-beast was in the A+ tier. After the Shaman inclusion and slight nerf, this build has been slightly downgraded to an A-. A lot has changed from the Cheat Sheet, specifically the optimal build from using Witchers (Fallen Witcher + Taboo Witcher) to Kiras (Venomancer + Ogre Mage):  

1. Use hunters to transition early. To transition into this build, you must have a strong early game. An item indication is an early *Shadow Edge* and a *Claw Wand* split (hammer and life crystal).  
2. Spend moderately at Round 17 to either upgrade your Beast units or to activate the (4) or (6) Beast synergy. You can use a 2* Fallen Witcher for the meantime.  
3. Return to 50 gold and fast level to 9. Utilize duplicates to utilize the (2) Insectoid synergies in the meantime.  
4. Save enough gold to the point where you're sure you can roll for a 2* Venomancer at the very least.  
5. Your end game should utilize double Venomancer carries.  

Note:  

1. If you have trouble finding a Venomancer and you're actually closer to a 3* Fallen Witcher. You can still opt into the Witcher variation and split your carries between 3* FW and Rogue Guard. Note: this variation demands more positioning than the Venomancer version and 2* FW will not do well against 5-dragons compared to 2* Venomancer.

**Full Dragon Mages** 
Overall Grade: A  
Effectiveness: A+  
Feasibility: A-  

[Cheat Sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/hl213t/season_6_cheatsheet_to_dragon_mages/)  
[In-depth Guide](http://zzbweb-abroad.dragonest.com/share/?fbclid=IwAR31MaibShroBPCHP4XbT78Nsq79TRXtWa-jXpWhpC3yjHjo-m7mNU_yhJA#/shareArticle?id=dbaa967daee&amp;language=en_US)   
[Sample-Shaman variant](https://imgur.com/a/vfhpvwz); [sample-Mages variant](https://imgur.com/a/QMg9uzV)  

As mentioned earlier, this is perhaps the second most popular build (at least in high rank). It matches up well against Cave-Glacier-Shaman, able to burst down the supporting cast, making it easier to sweep the remaining units. It's also open to (4) Shaman sharing similar units such as the (2) Wizards and Storm Shaman. The optimal build has changed; instead of Helicopter/Dark Spirit, use Storm Shaman instead.  

1. Not much has changed from it's playstyle. This build can do well either win streaking or lose streaking.  
2. With the meta having a slower pace, specifically in the mid-game, there is a greater emphasis on spending at level 9. Fast level to level 9 by Round 21 (lose streaking) to Round 21/25 (win streaking). Rolling conservatively (5-10 gold) to stabilize before those rounds are recommended--again, this is up to the user's discretion.  
3. There are also changes in item-wise. I prefer to give my magic dmg items to Tortola and Mana-only items to God of Thunder. The goal in this split is to ensure that Tortola Elder is able to insta-kill the three Shamans and accumulate all the Shaman hexes. I'll refer to this unit who's role is to insta-kill the shamans as the ""initial sweeper"". God of Thunder is also better when there are less targets, so it makes sense to keep him alive to the point where he is able to cast his ability twice or even three times.  

Notes:  

1. You can opt into adding (4) Shamans in the late game. Replacing either Tortola or God of Thunder and Flaming Wizard for Scryer and Defector/Lava Shaman. Split magic damage and mana items between Storm Shaman and the other mage carry (Tort/GoT) whp will be the ""initial sweeper"".  
2. Give Venom armor items and even mana items such as pulse staff. Venom can be crucial in sweeping Sacred Lancer/Berzerker.  
3. A Sacred Lancer 2* or a 1* with items will typically counter this build hard.  
4. Using the (4) Shaman variant is only a 50/50 situation. Sometimes it's still better to run 6-mages especially when you don't have the magic-dmg items to execute the *Initial Sweep*.  


---  

The original Season 6-Cheat Sheets also included Insectoids and Divinity-Warlocks. Both builds I haven't used too often in the current meta, thus, I can't provide any tips or updates. ""Do they have a place in the meta?"" I wouldn't count them out just yet. The playstyles definitely just need to be updated based on the criteria of splitting carries and being strong in the early game. Unfortunately, for these particular builds, Insectoids can't reliable spike early, and Divinity is much too reliant on Water Spirit to carry. Divinity also gets countered by Lava Shaman relatively easily. Though, [Divinity-Shamans](https://imgur.com/a/WtIgp2f) may be a reasonable build to explore.","Updating the Cheat Sheets for Rest of the Season 6 (ft. 6-beast, feathered, mages)"

AutoChess,"So me and my friend recently got into auto chess, and he has taken a real liking to forcing summoners every game, and somehow winning 80% of the games he plays. I've been trying to play a variety of different builds and use strategies based on what the shop gives me rather than force a build every game, but I cant seem to beat his summoner build! Any suggestions on some good counters?",Good counters to summoner?
AutoChess,"I love the idea of having a monthly/quarterly tournament implemented, however, I feel like they missed something. 

I managed to qualify for the Monthly portion of the Championship tournaments both times. However, due to my job, I don't normally play at peak hours, especially during the weekend, when my job is the busiest. Both months, I only managed to get into 3 of the 5 games, meaning I have almost no chance to actually qualify for the main event. This is frustrating as this month, I need less than 600 runes to be in the top 32 to get into the main event. 

I haven't been able to think of a way to fix this, other than not having a job, which isn't feasible. I think they really should change how matches are found for the tournament, as it would allow people with more unorthodox schedules to have a chance at participating. 

Any suggestions??",My problem with the Championship Tournament

AutoChess,"I cant decide if 9 warrior with the typical doom or rogue carry is better than 6 warrior with kira/ stacked veno. 

Obviously there is a lot of power in 9 warrior synergy with a 2* doom or rogue carry 
but 6 warrior kira/veno  synergizes at 8 pieces with the quicker powerspike and allows for warlock egersis synergies as well. 

Lately I've been rushing the 6 warrior kira/veno and that carries me into the late game. And then I will switch to 9 warrior with doom or rogue.
The problem is it's hard to drop the kira synergy with a stacked 2* veno and go into 9 warrior.  
Even if I do find a rogue guard it seems like half the time it's worse to switch over to 9 warrior until its 2*.
After watching my 2* veno run over everyone for 10 rounds its hard to give it up for a better late game comp. 

I've tried it both ways and I honestly cant decide what is a better final comp. 
It must depend game to game what other comps are played, What pieces and items I get. 

I'm sure someone on here has more experience and knows what item/piece breakpoints make each comp better 
Just wondering what synergy people think is better and why. Or what situations make each comp better than the other",9 warrior vs 6 warrior veno

AutoChess,,Why you should spam 5 Dragons
AutoChess,"In the previous patch which saw buffs to Beasts, Evil Knight, Argali Knight, and Shadow Crawler. For this weeks meta power rankings, other than the rise of beasts, not much has changed. Knights and assassins are still considered by most players as niche builds and Abby, being a $2 costs, is still considered more valuable than Shadow Crawler.

* **9 Warriors** (Last Week: 1st)

[\(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days\)](https://preview.redd.it/l21k9ufwx5d51.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d82ab7ca14709cb124c2eae45666862f745cf590)

*Units: Tusk Champion, Red Axe Chief, Abyssal Guard, Swordsman, Werewolf, Ghost Kid, Pirate Captain, Berzerker, Doom Arbiter/Rogue Guard + Flex Unit (Siren, Devastator, or Dark Spirit)* 

Still the most popular build in the current meta. This is probably due to their linear power spike path. In the early game, warriors have access to obtain significant upgrades at lower levels with Swordsman and Abby Guard both both being relatively cheap at 2-cost and having the ability to carry in the early game and even contest hunters. In the mid-game, players can easily push to level 9 and find and activate 9-warriors by Round 21. Lots of players are also pointing out that Doom's ability to shut down ability reliant carries who are dominating the meta such as Warpwood Sage, Water Spirit, and Fallen Witcher is fairly overpowered especially when combined with blink dagger given the almost instant casting animation.  

Although, they aren't necessarily performing at levels one could consider 'unbalanced,' should we expect some slight nerfs to some warrior units or warriors as a whole? 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Divinity Warlocks** (Last Week: 3rd) 

[\(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days\)](https://preview.redd.it/se0vzj0906d51.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb4528c1c65197fbf4aff26b735800cc82cfa099)

*Units: God of War, Goddess of Light, Grand Herald, Grimtouch, Water Spirit, Desperate Doctor, Soul Reaper, Venomancer/Poisonous Worm + Flex Units (Warpwood Sage, Scryer, Doom Arbiter, etc.)* 

Divinity-Warlocks are trending upwards in terms of popularity. However, compared to last week, their win rate has slightly fallen due to several reasons. Such reasons include players now opting to transition into marines and incorporating Doom in their builds to counter this build. People are now more weary of this build as well, meaning Divinity-Warlock players will often be contested. Regardless, this build that utilizes two of the strongest abilities in the current game in Water Spirit and Warpwood Sage as well as a very strong combo wombo in Grimtouch + Desperate Doctor or even Warpwood Sage, keeps this build rising in popularity. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Beast Witcher** (Last Week: Honorable Mentions)

[\(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days\)](https://preview.redd.it/o7v0mexf26d51.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f50d2c8fcb954691c629dfbdfe626f220451c70)

*Units: Unicorn, Tusk Champion, Poisonous Worm, Lord of Sand, Werewolf, Razor Claw, Taboo Witcher, Fallen Witcher, Rogue Guard*

The highlight of this week, 6-beasts, Demon, Withcers with Fallen Witcher carry, has come back into the meta. This build has had the most fluctuations this season, being one of the most popular builds at the start of Season 6. However, following a change to their synergy stacking damage effect from magic damage to physical damage, the build was simply not as effective to most players. Last week Beasts received a buff from 20 to 25 added stack-able damage and is now third on the meta power rankings. However, these surprisingly good stats: 30.8% win rate, and 2.9 average placing, seem to come at a high-cost.

[\(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days\)](https://preview.redd.it/9jiidhbp26d51.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ec2f299e0692e039569fcaa12fbcb79eba286c)

Not too far away is the incomplete version; perhaps, the version that wasn't able to fully upgrade the Fallen Witcher or to find the Rogue Guard. Although this build is popular, be weary, for the chances to succeed with it are still very much in the 50/50 region. For that reason, this build sits at 3rd this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Feathered Hunters** (Last Week: 2nd)  

[\(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days\)](https://preview.redd.it/yxvajna866d51.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8adfdae2a4a3e7295fd11fe332d92fa9ba7f3e08)

(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days)

(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Class: Hunters | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days)

*Units: Dwarf Sniper, Shining Archer, Wind Ranger, Warpwood Sage, Whisper Seer, Taboo Witcher, Shining Assassin + Flex units (Fallen Witcher, Siren, Scryer, Grimtouch, etc.)* 

Hunters fall two spots down from 2nd to 4th on this week's power rankings; but, that isn't to say they're experiencing a fall from grace. Hunters are still a very strong build and is suitable for climbing ranks. They are still the strongest build to run in the early game. However, hunters generally fall off in the late game because a fully upgraded Dwarf Sniper doesn't scale as well as other late-game hyper carries such as Fallen Witcher, Water Spirit, and others. This means, they're often defined by their mid-game. As such, require a lot of aggression in the mid-game to push out or disrupt the flow of compositions looking to transition into the late game. This play style is perhaps much more demanding on skill factors such as gauging lobbies and managing economies/streaks. As a result, using the filter King instead of Rook would yield much better results of this build. Conversely, this build is not as successful in Bishops ranks and lower. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Insectoid Assassins**

[\(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days\)](https://preview.redd.it/s21nqvmd86d51.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85c5c765c9a6489dda1bf4d2bffe2e61aea1ee63)

(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days)

(Source: Pocket Auto Chess | Class: Hunters | Rank: Rook | Duration: 3 days)

 *Units: Abyssal Crawler, Lord of Sand, Poisonous Worm, Thorn Predator, Spider Queen\\*

The fifth and final spot of this week's power rankings goes to this Insectoid Assassin build mainly utilizing Abyssal Crawler as a carry unit. Though, Goblin's aren't too far apart--sharing similar stats in both popularity and win rates. Using Abyssal Crawler as a carry may favor Insectoid players over the Kira build due to its accessibility. With this version, using a fairly strong early game synergy such as assassins can make the transition into Insectoids easier. Of course, this build truly shines in the late game because Abyssal Crawler is able to fully thrive from items due to her passive ability to scale in the middle of battles.
