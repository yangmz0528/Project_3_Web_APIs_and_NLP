TeamfightTactics,"Astral is already a completely dominant force in TFT right now, with atleast 3 people forcing it every game, why make it even worse by buffing 9 Astral?

TFT balance changes starting to look like LoL...",Why the hell buff ASol?
TeamfightTactics,"Is it just me or does this set feel a lot more stale compared to the previous ones? As said in the title, after playing a few rounds today I got really bored and began thinking how this is the first set where this has happened to me. And here is my reasoning why:

Most traits seem a little bit too basic/boring(looking at you Swiftshot)

The dragons were interesting at first but by now they feel stale as well

The treasure dragon is a nice addition for bad luck protection but isn't really anything flashy either

Talking about the champions, most of them are fine design-wise I guess but none of the 4 or 5 costs are really flashy either compared to for example Jinx/Viktor/Kai'sa/Zeri/Seraphine/Jhin, from the last set etc.

Most of the chase traits aren't really worth pursuing, since they are hard to hit and even when hit barely get me first or even second place because they are losing to some basic spammable comp(looking at you Astral Varus)

And for my last point and the most personal one: Shimmerscale is fine and all, but give me back my mercenaries!

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be interested in how others here have perceived this set in consideration of my points and would be very interested in your points of view! And for those wondering about my rank, on average I was about dia 3, last set finally hit masters and this set I am really not interested in ranked so only plat 3.",I played a few rounds today and the boredom just really hit me...
TeamfightTactics,"4% doesn't feel nearly as good as 5%. It would be nice to be able to play 5 costs without having to force 9 to stabilize a chase trait. 

Also it feels even worse when someone gets a 2 star 5 cost at level 8 now because it's just a bigger ""fuck you"" by the game.

I understand certain units have been overbuffed at the gold tier (like ASol) and most 5 costs are pretty good, but some comps really need that 5 cost to be online and it really feels bad sometimes",Should level 8 revert to 5% for a 5 cost?
TeamfightTactics,i have played before but was never good. i went and played hyper roll.( it‚Äôs quicker) and i found it fun. i just get knocked out every round though. my characters just always attack the giant 100000000 health tank( they just have a lot of health) and my fake adc dies to assassin and my real one dies aswell. if someone could give me tips for items who to buy and what traits.

TeamfightTactics,"So i just now played a an Astral game and i was highrolling my mind out (a ton of early buys without rolls, start with +2 Teamsize but double damage).

Game goes late and me and another Astral dude end up dueling it out. We both have all 3-Stars except my Varus. He got Aurelion already, mind you, but that doesn‚Äòt matter. So i roll for the last Varus, i would only have needed one to complete my Astral set and start getting Aurelions. But i just can not find one. I rolled a few times above 50 gold, then rolled down my entire stack. Even with the Astral trait - no Varus. 

The enemy 3-Star Varus and my almost-3-Star total to 17 Varus(es?). Shouldn‚Äòt there have been one left? He did not hold one, i checked several times. I also checked after game if any of the already lost dudes had one, nope, but they would have entered the pool again anyways, right?

So what happened here? I can‚Äòt believe that the odds were THAT against me, i mean i surely had 20+ Astral-chance rolls looking solely for Varus‚Ä¶",Does pool size fluctuate?

They removed Xahay that wiped board, instead they added a unit that ON LEVEL ONE does that, regardless of what you have on board. I'm not crying about xayah, She is my favorite carry, at least used to be. I wanted to improve my game so I switched from her and played flex. But I mean come on. Seeing A sol on 3-5 is just as toxic as seeing 3\* astrals everywhere. Also also GM+ Players tend to spam corki cuz well, you can burst everything with revel + sona.

Tried to reposition him multiple times but I couldn't target him nor could I pick him up.

He didn't become hostile to my team either. Fought alongside my units against the others but simply couldn't be picked up. No hitbox overlapping either.

Positioning is key for Top 1-2, unless you're highrolling so much that positioning doesn't matter (which rarely if ever happens). Which means this IS the most game altering bug I've seen so far.

My friend and I play double up on the weekends, maybe 10 games in total over the course of 3 evenings.
The problem is simple, we ALWAYS go on huge loss streaks until we're extremely low.
Don't get me wrong, comebacks do happen from time to time and they're unbelievably rewarding, but the other 97% we just get 4th.
I'm really struggling to find out what we're doing wrong.
I obviously can't describe every single thing we do/don't for you to analyze, but do you maybe have general tips for not losing the early rounds?
Like we have decent comps, not the strongest by a Longshot but most of the time we feel like we should be able to compete with the rest of the lobby.
One thing I know I do and my friend doesn't is leveling. Like when we're lvl 4 and there are 4 exp left, I level, he doesn't. Same with later levels, I'm usually 1 level above him (this has gotten better, he has started to do this more often as well).
Another thing I've noticed is that we tend to keep our items for later use. I know we could probably start winning more if we just slammed the items early on, but it feels like such a huge waste most of the time

Again, any general tips would be appreciated. Specific strategies are less welcome, but I'd still like to learn so feel free if you got any",Need help not losing every round until at &lt;10HP

Also, not to mention when I need Yasuo he's nowhere near to be found (even rolling 30-40g at 9) other times I hit him at 7 but haven't planned for 9 Dragonmancer and I've played enough 6-D-Yasuo.

Anyway, this is my Ted Talk.

Thanks for coming! Stay safe!

TeamfightTactics,"Aside from rolling, which is partly skill expression, how do you not tilt from constant bad RNG and enemies getting good RNG? Here‚Äôs what I mean. 

If I‚Äôm low HP and need an item, it‚Äôs either a) on a 1 cost early or 1/2 cost late b) taken by the other guy cause the item went his way or c) not on carousel. 

If some guy randomly levels off interval 5 on 2-3 or 6 on 2-6 or even 7 on 3-2 I swear I always fight them. 

If some guy randomly hits an early dragon or just spikes late game by hitting 3* or hitting the rest of their board I play them that round. 

Never playing the sin players when I position for them and taking infinite from other matchups but as soon as I don‚Äôt position for them I play them. 

Getting trash items while my opponents get great items on the golem/herald rounds. 

Having 4 items after krugs and losing infinite hp cause you have no board strength. 

Rotating into the strongest person as soon as I can especially when it‚Äôs my last life while the other guy who could die faces one of the weakest opponents. 

Zoe rolling laser every other spell but enemy Zoe‚Äôs always roll stasis at the perfect time followed by a tornado.

Aegis Esports is back once again with our seasonal community TFT Invitational that allows all players interested in competitive TFT have a chance at competing with one another for a chance to win some big money. This is our largest invitational prize pool we have offered to date and it's all thanks to you the community for supporting us since SET 6 by playing in our weeklies. We try to do these once a set as a thank you, but to also introduce players to the world of competitive TFT.   


This is our first time as well that we've opened the qualifiers to not just the NA server but EUW as well to help better serve the EU community with a much friendlier time zone that is more reasonable for them compared to having to stay up late for the NA time zone. This means we have 8 qualifier tournaments this invitational, and you can play in as many as you want. **Please note that anybody can play in these events,** regardless of your rank and server. You just need to have an account on the server that tournament qualifier takes place on.

TeamfightTactics,"Simple topic, what‚Äôs your favorite Mirage Variation and which do you never take. 

I think if I had to put them in order it would be: spellsword, executioner, dawn bringer, dexterity, warlord, pirates, then electrocution. 

Spellsword is amazing and something like rageblade, JG, and IE works stupid well. It‚Äôs like 1 ult and half their team is gone, by the second ult almost everything is gone, if their carry is still alive the 3 cast 1 shots them every time. 

Executioner is great because it provides good damage and has more interesting builds. 

Dawn bringer is just like super OP. Not as fun to play because the mechanic is boring but with all that regen your board lasts and Daeja with Rageblade and AE has tons of time to ramp up. The other day I had 8 mirage, hallucinate, and 3 star Leona and 3 star Braum with mirage. They couldn‚Äôt touch my front line. 

Dexterity is Ok but it doesn‚Äôt seem to perform as well. Could be bad luck though I definitely want to try it more. 

Warlord just feels like a worse version of spell sword. Not bad but not great either. 

Pirates chest is cool and the extra items and gold is rad, it just doesn‚Äôt have as much combat power so you need to get lucky with good items from it and have multiple carries. It can still work out just not as reliable. 

Electroshock suckssss. Tried to make it work but it just doesn‚Äôt perform really. I think it can but you need so many things to make it work like Leona 3, heroic presence, great items, hallucinate, and then maybe.  

So that‚Äôs my list and why, so what do you think? Which variations do you like?

Bonus question: do you think Mirage is better or worse than mutant?",Mirage variations

TeamfightTactics,"Yesterday I played Astral 6. Got all goldens super early and dominated the early game. Got the meta items for Varus (Deathblade, Rageblade, Runaan's) and all it was lacking from being a perfect Astral build was some tank items for Illaoi. All in all, an extremely good start for an Astral run.

I finished fucking 5th. I entered the late game in first place with more than 80 health and lost consecutively till I finished 5th. Now I opted to put some mystics to get that MR going, I could have put a Ryze and a Twitch to get Swiftshot and Mage, but considering how people were completely steamrolling me, that wasn't going to cut it. 

I am not complaining about my placement. All the builds that were ahead of me deserved their spot: 1st was playing Shapeshifters, 2nd was playing Whispers, 3rd was playing assassin bruisers and 4th was playing Corki.

I am complaining however about how much people cry about Astrals. 

What is it that is so broken about them? Is it having to lose streak the early game? Is it about other players being able to grief you by buying your champions from the pool? Is it about your comp's viability depending on the other players in the match? Is it the fact that your dragon is completely useless without full itemization? 

In this particular match I narrated, there was this one guy who had, as far as champions and synergies go, an undeniably weaker build than me. He howevever had a Diana with Frozen Heart. That was it: one item and my build suddenly had no damage, as Varus was taking years to stack rageblade. Yet people talk about it like it was completely uncounterable.

Astral is a reasonable comp for getting 4th or 3rd place but is completely incapable of getting something higher than that.",Astrals are not broken. They aren't even good.

TeamfightTactics,"Done on mobile, excuse the format. Yes this is a rant post, but I've not seen this brought up too much yet.

TLDR: Healing's Busted, just like League.

No, its not Astral (I mean yes it is but thats another can of worms). No, its not Ragewing. No, its not Mages. Its not even Jade, back when that was getting forced what seemed like every game.

The problem this set is the healing.

Every one of the ""problem"" comps share something in common, and its their ability to heal frequently and heal a lot. Every mage comp has a nami and vlad putting in work while ryze sits in the back with a hextech gunblade. Every rageblade comp stacks bloodthirsters on top of their natural omnivamp. Every jade comp has percent healing on top of a Soraka. Legends or Dragonmancer? Better slap omnivamp on Volibear or else he's useless. It wouldn't be so bad if there were more sources of healing cut, but all we've got is one item (Sunfire), a few abilities (Pyke comes to mind), and a handful of random augments that you'd only want to run if there's nothing better, if you even get them in the first place. I can't tell you how many times a board is nearly dead just for the nami to get her heal off and full heal the carry despite mage 3 reducing ability power. And the self heal monster frontline champs this season are out of control. I'm just tired of seeing another three star nami and vlad out sustain my DPS again and again.

TeamfightTactics,"
I feel like Almost Every Game that I end Up in the 5-8th place are games where There are Multiple Astrals. Theres a certain point where astrals all get a heavy powerspike and just become unstoppable until late late game. A lot of the times people will have six 3-Starred Champions before the dragon shrine. Alot of the times this powerspike happens around the time your just getting your dragon. 

It Happens Early and happens suddenly. Astrals typically will go from a team of 2 star units, will get a 3 star unit, then 3 more 3-star units within 5 rounds or less. then in 1-2 rounds they‚Äôll have all 6 3 star units. 

Multiple astrals turn ur 10 round winstreak into a sudden 3-5 lose streak with basically you rapidly losing the rest of the rounds with the occasional win against a non-astral Team. up until late/endgame. If your still alive that is‚Ä¶

Its really upsetting that 80% of teams just become inferior to astrals midgame and a lot of the times becomes impossible to get to late game where your able to turn the tides. and even then astrals are still extremely strong and once they get asol or 2 star asol (or any other strong highcost unit) the chances of getting 1st place is unlikely.
I feel like astrals dominate hard and are very low risk high reward. it feels really unhealthy for the game in my opinion.
Astrals were suppose to be the yordles of set 7 but apparently unlike yordles who were typically on the weaker side compared to other champions and it was a higher risk to play a yordle team since you were depending on end game results to get viegar. Astrals feel just as strong as other champions and typically have some pretty damn strong units like Nami, Varus, Nidalee, and Illaoi that your able to 100% 3 star risk free.
Another difference from yordles is that with yordles your playing for the end game. getting 3 stars on all your yordles took time, and it typically wasnt until the top 2-3 where you got viegar. typically a 2 star Viegar = GG. even a 1 star viegar was pretty powerful. With Astrals, 3 Starring your champions is extremely easy, too easy really. I‚Äôve noticed there already are plenty of astrals normally, but then getting a 100% chance of getting astrals in ur shop every 5th shop makes it so so much easier. ive seen people getting 3 star champions at as early as level 4 and by level 6 had all 6 3-stars. 

Literally playing end game while everyone else was in mid game.

Astral‚Äôs heavy 3-star low risk high reward powerspike is almost always guaranteed to get top 4. their midgame is just so strong that they roll everyone in their path and typically the only thing that gets in their way are other astrals. 

I‚Äôm really starting to not have fun on tft anymore. if anything, its really just starting to frustrate me and wear and tear me down. set 6 was loads of fun and there never really was a 1 unit purchase that is able to completely turn the tides of a game like there are in set 7. It made it feel like there was always a fair chance. With set 7, there are units that singlehandly turn ur 7th-8th place into an automatic atleast 4th place. like for example: Yasuo.
the person in last place that is first pick that is able to get priority and pick Yasuo somehow starts a 8 game winstreak and gets 4th place? like somehow 1 star bloodthirster yasuo can beat my 2 star diana, syfen, 2 star yone, and 2 star olaf? that makes a lot of sense to me. 

Most of the time I just get shutdown by a bunch of astrals nowadays. every game that ive lost early have 1-3 astrals in the top 4 position. even when theres 6 astrals in a game and almost every team comp that i can choose from is uncontested and i have no problem getting any champs I want. I‚Äôll still have a Very Difficult time getting to top 4. Let alone 1st place. 

Some people will probably say: ‚Äúwell why dont u just play astrals then if its so broken?‚Äú well i really just dislike the idea of astrals. its the least creative thing in the entire game, and is just plain boring. theres absolutely no variation to the team at all, like every game you KNOW your going to get 3 star varus, you KNOW your going to get 3 star Illaoi, etc, etc, etc. positioning hardly matters with astrals either, like your going to stack tank items on illaoi and frontline her, you know your going to stack damage items on varus and backline him. you know your going to buy spear of soujins for nami. and its the same exact game every game. the only real change is adding the 1-2 extra units. and even then its typically going to be something like Ryze as your carry/secondary. 
I wanna have a game where I dont know if I‚Äôll get my beefy wtf 3-star Chinese Nunu who eats units like breakfast. thats the fun part of tft, not knowing how my team will turn out and being able to win my games off of the random outcomes of units that appeared in my shop.

Anyways Im sorry for the long rant. I really want to know other peoples opinions on astrals in the game. I really want to know if im not the only person who absolutely despise astrals to the core.",A Rant about Astrals And my personal opinion and explanation for my deep rooted hatred towards it.

I dont know how more perfect this game could be.  
I chose trade sector to take advantage of the free reroll to get Astrals faster. Then Think Fast helped me get my Skarner 3 and a few Varus that I eventually algo got to 3 stars.  


Then I thought ""hmm, wouldnt it be fun to get a recombobulator now?""   
Well... I give you the ultimate recombobulator:  
\- Varus 3 into Shi Oh Yu 3 star with sword and Guinsoo already equipped  
\-Illaoi 2 into Neeko with Warmog and armor already equipped  
\-Skarner 3 into Gnar  
\-Nidalee 2 into Elise 2  
\-Nami into Anivia.  


I only had to find a Nidalee to make it Shapeshifter 4 and I just cruised to victory. I eventually found 5 other Neeko and used my duplicator to get her to 3 stars.

TeamfightTactics,"Why is round length consistent throughout the whole game? How can rounds at the start last as much as the ones in endgame?

I understand it's probably not an issue for the top players, but for the average player the later rounds are unplayable.. Absolutely no time to prep properly, re-arrange units, comps, items, or positioning. It feels horrible, induces panic, and is sucking the fun out of the game every time once we get to the last few rounds.

Is there any hope they make early rounds shorter and later rounds longer? I feel like even just adding 10 seconds once most players are lvl 8-9 would be extremely helpful. Thoughts?","As a new player, lategame rounds are way too short.."

TeamfightTactics,"Hey guys ! 

I'm a former Riven OTP who transitioned to TFT. I climbed to master in JP a while ago and it was slow and painful; I decided to do the same on my EUW account to see if that server has a different playstyle, or if there is any skill gap. And since I got covid, I had plenty of time to play.

All in all, I was able to go from unranked to master in 69 games and 6 days:

https://imgur.com/a/RNH7JOG

To be honest, since JP is such a small server, I expected the EUW server to be more challenging; but the EUW server feels objectively easier than the JP one. Maybe it's just my elo; I suspect that at challenger level, the EU server becomes harder than the JP server (because more people).

People in JP play super aggressive early, lobbies are very high tempo, people take lots of risk so there's always 2+ guys highrolling. 

Grieffing an item / a loss streak is also harder on the JP server because if someone sees you in losing streak, they'll super grief you (they'll even open fort if need be).

Also, people in EU rage in chat more than in JP (but the rage is nothing compared to LoL).

Mistakes I've seen the most are : 
 * Contest slowrolls when too many people are contesting
 * Wrong augments for the comp being played / wrong understanding of why x comp is strong (which is fair, because this game is so deep and complex)
 * Poor emblems / spatula management (honestly guys, use https://www.metatft.com/comps when in doubt; this site is honestly amazing and even gives you info on which spatula / emblem to play)
 * Stick to the late game too much (some games are gonna be losses, better take 6th rather than 8th; don't hold units you'll never triple, instead, sacrifice them for a slight advantage)

All in all, I think any player who learns 3 - 4 comps (scalescorn, Elise, Varus / Mages, Cannoneer) + the best augments / items and variations of each comp + learns to play agressive should be able to reach Diamond pretty easily.

Based on all the mistakes I made, I believe that a challenger should be able to reach master in EU in 25 - 40 games. 

In any case, it was an amazing learning experience and if you're reading this and want to ask any question, feel free to do so ! 

Cheers !

TeamfightTactics,"Treasure Dragon with 1g reroll and damn near five minutes to choose something from it, augment rerolls, and much safer gold generation compared to previous seasons makes this entire set brainless. 

In the previous set, you were punished if you forced a comp too hard because someone else could have a weird combination with BIS that would have steamrolled you. In this set, forcing a comp is trivial with multiple chances to get exactly what you need with BIS items for at least one of your carries.

As soon as Astrals are nerfed, another meta comp or two will pop up that is slightly over-tuned, and hitting it will be equally trivial.",Astrals are a symptom of the real problem. This entire set is too reliable. Forcing any composition with BIS items for your carry is brainless. The only difference is that augments are 100% make-or-break.

TeamfightTactics,"Recently started getting into tft after my friends convinced me to try it. I came to find I quite enjoy the strategizing and rng aspects of the game but have found that the game crashes during an average of like 1 out of 3 games. Sometimes twice in a game and I've noticed it tends to happen from orbs, particularly the treasure dragon orb.

Ive been playing league for years with no issues besides occasional lag/fps drops but nothing like what I experience on tft. It seems backwards to me, id think surely the MOBA modes are more demanding?

When tft crashes I can't even ctr+alt delete to get task manager and close it out. I have to restart my PC to get back into the game and in ranked it can mean the difference of top four or not. Kinda frustrating. I've changed all graphics settings to be on the lowest.. PC is a Lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 with an additional terabyte SSD that I store bigger games on. The device has plenty of RAM and dedicated graphics card, I play ark survival on medium settings with no problems so why the hell does tft seem so demanding?

Is this even like legal?","I got 6 gold from Krugs, is this bugged?"
TeamfightTactics,"**Background on me:** 

I started playing TFT in set 6 and immediately fell in love. I have no prior experience playing League (not my thing), which is to say all the characters and items are foreign to me. I have made it to platinum by memorizing and optimizing a few comps from guides earlier than other folks. It was fun at first, but after a while it got stale. I watch some folks on YouTube (k3soju, boxbox, bunnymuffins) and I see them playing with a lot more fluidity. I know a lot of these are basically highlight reels and also these people are experts, but I would like to improve my fluid game.

**Where I struggle:** 

I usually can crush the early/mid game. It's the transition to the end game where I fall like a brick.  I get overwhelmed if I need to do a major transition, or my mid carry items don't fit the end game carries I'm getting RNG. I see the pros keep a few strategic units on the bench for pivoting and I'm never totally sure what those units are in every situation.

**The big question:** 

What is the best way to play fluid? (I understand ranked, fluid play is not the optimal strategy, I honestly don't mind if I lose a little more, I just want to improve at it)

**Sub-questions:**

* When you're crushing early/mid, how do you transition? Base it on items? High cost carries you're finding through RNG?
* How do you know which units to hold for late game pivoting?
* If you have an A or B tier comp mid game, do you try to look for the S or just min/max what you have?
* When you slam items how do you determine when? Is it when you're near death or other tipping points?
* How do you know if your comp has the right amount of damage/defense/utility for the round you are in? Are there specific numbers you are looking for at specific rounds or is it just feel based on the competition? Scouting the competition?

I'm sure a lot of this is memorization, feel and situationally dependent, but if anyone has any good pointers they would be much appreciated.",Best Fluid Strategies

TeamfightTactics,"So first thing to note, I‚Äôm not a fan of mages and their position right now. It‚Äôs a broken comp and I don‚Äôt like forcing broken comps for easy wins. That being said when the game gives me Sylas Ryze opener? I‚Äôll play it for a bit until I can transition. 

As with any other mage game there‚Äôs 2 people HARD forcing mages with astral. Whatever my Ryze is doing well for now and my boards looking pretty nice for a mage comp and I have a lot of gold. Stage 3-2 hits I‚Äôm level 6 and think fast is an option.  Now I‚Äôm rarely a fan of it because often time you don‚Äôt end up with anything ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and you‚Äôre now down a prismatic. 

I say fuck it pick it quick sell my bench units I was planning to pivot to and roll like a madman. At 3-2 I had Ryze 3, Sylas 3, and 6 Illaoi. Holy crap the stupidity of how hard my board went lol. I grieved my items but it didn‚Äôt matter still an easy ass first. Final board was 4 bruiser 5 mages with mage Illaoi who stole so much defense with 2 ults it was insane. Ryze had Shojin, JG, and IE. Tons of damage and silver celestial kept him up but trading gunblade for IE would have been better and kept my front line alive forever. Although with how tanky Sylas is now plus Illaoi gunblade doesn‚Äôt feel as needed to  stall things.  Sylas had gargoyle, spark, and QSS. Not great but not bad. Spark helped Ryze and QSS gave dodge and kept him from getting CC‚Äôd and casting his ults for big shields.  I‚Äôll had mage spat, redemption, and shroud. 

First time playing mages since their out of control buff (intentionally avoiding them). Now I‚Äôve tried it though and yeah... OP as fuck   The most notable thing for me was how anti heal wasn‚Äôt need at all. Like at the end of fights your healing was useless. Once Ryze targeted something, it was dead. Towards the end each ball did 2000+ damage. No matter how much MR or health, that unit was going down.  I think his orbs should hit harder at the start, but not scale.  What makes him strong and unique is that after a few cast he casts so many orbs you can‚Äôt survive. The damage doesn‚Äôt need to scale too. 

I wonder how a silly build like Shojinx2 and rageblade would work. Seems like it would still scale out of control.  Less damage per orb, but way more orbs.",El oh el at thinkfast

So far, I found nothing promizing, and the lack of proper frontline is a real problem: with all 4 evokers (base ones, no spat), you have 3 slots for your frontline and no obvious synergy with the evokers (I wouldn't count astral as a synergy with aurelion sol). I focused on a 2 bruiser frontline, including ornn, with ez as an additional backline for early carry and to charges evokers with his Q spam ( and eventually sell him to make room for aurelion sol), but it's simply too frail.

My best result ATM is 3rd in gold ranked with dragon alliance and a classic braum + idas frontline. Fun as hell, but not something you can replicate easily.

This set, I just love it, it feels good to play it. I've doubled the number of game played in this one than any others. 

I can play how I always wanted. Flex. It took me about 130 games to reach it. From my lowest hard stuck P4 0LP to D4 1 LP it took me 22 games to reach it with 7 from P2 to D4 w/o hard forcing comps.

Heres the link for my lolchess for my stats, games and trait usage.   
You can also see the LP gain graph where before July 9th I was basically stuck and after I learned the game played and rapidly went up.

[https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/yuumibestcat/s7](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/yuumibestcat/s7) (If link doesn't work its ""Yuumi Best Cat"" in NA)

Q. What comp did you play?

FLEX(+/-)!  From bronze to P3 I hard forced comps. I had a hard time in Gold as hard forcing comp iscontested but eventually grinded it out to plat. In Plat, it just left me with no flexibility and got stuck. After a lot of trial and errors, I eventually learned how to play the game as designed and shot from P4 0LP to D4 1LP ( You can see it in the LP graph).

Q. What content creator did you watch?

For learning new comp I didn't watched anyone specific. I was just watching multiple different video for the same comp, to see different way to transition to the comp with different starts. As for a streamer this is where I'd like to do a special shoutout to Mortdog. He basically taught me what I now consider the basics for the game with the bonus of being able to ask anything for stream points.",After 7 Set I finally reached Diamond!

TeamfightTactics,"So, I'm a new player to TFT. Have played a lot of Underlords and some Autochess too. I'm now trying to get into this game, but there seems to be some things missing.   


The one that pops out the most is the lack of a dropdown menu that shows every player's health/ gold/ level/ units in play and in bench/ items. The best example of one is in Underlords - it is clean, easy to read, and has all that information. Having to click on every player separately to get it is a lot of unnecessary work, considering a simple menu could show all of that in one single click.   


Anyway, just wondering if this is something that has ever been present in TFT, or if the creators have ever adressed putting it in at some point.","Dropdown menu with all players, info"

TeamfightTactics,"I was running a full tempest comp and had gotten tacticians crown and level 7 and started rolling, i immediately found that one percent chance Ao Shin and slammed him down on my board.  
I was then heavily dissapointed when the next round ended before he could fire his ability. And the one after that, and the one after that.  
Ao Shin has a max mana of 200, and starts at 0. He needs 20 atatcks to cast and he does not have a mana gaining trait in evoker, like Aurelion. Even with the tempest traits boosted attack speed he either never got to fire his lightning rain because My qiyana and lee had already swept the field, or the front line had broken down and he got shredded. The few times he did fire the damage and mana steal wasnt enough to save him because the rest of my comp had already died and he was facing two or three units. I was losing until i replaced Ao Shin, in a full tempest comp, with a one star syfen. A cheaper dragon was better than ao shin in his own comp. I understand that a Shojins spear would make it faster, but i dont think an item should be nessecary for a five cost dragon to do more than 500 damage. He feels like easily the weakest 5 cost and the weakest dragon in general. i feel like he shoulf have some kind of change so he can really make an impact on a noard.",Ao shins mana cost makes him really weak for a 5 cost dragon.

TeamfightTactics,,Star Guardian Dragons - crossover when?
TeamfightTactics,"hey guys, been playing since set 2. 

I know that every comp has a ""flavor patch"" but jesus, I just need somewhere to vent. I've been up and down plat all day (day off, give me a break).

when I climb divisions, I am literally FORCING/SPAMMING cannons or astral. 

nothing else, even when the game is GIVING me comps, will let me top 4. 

oh you want to play tempest? too bad you lose to cannons. oh you wanna play whisper? cannons. shapeshifters? cannons will eat right through that. 

let's not even talk about HOW nerfed these comps are. 

who is the carry in tempest? lee sin? need dragonmancer or he won't make it. ao shin? a 10 cost dragon?  okay sure riot. 

any of these comps can work, but you have to high roll them and even then, youre playing for 3/4th compared to the people forcing cannons or astral. 

&amp;#x200B;

i thought people were forcing those comps because they were meta. no...they are forcing those comps because even a full 1 star cannon comp beats 2\* comps of almost anything else. 

ffs I lost a round to a 3\* illaoi with warmogs and titan's wrath, my 2\* with BT. HoJ, IE literally just couldn't kill her fast enough to get anywhere near the back line. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a lot of bullshit patches, but all of the comps are ""average"" and then people force some meta ones, usually the guys who hit end up 1/2nd. 

now you got 6 players running cannons or astrals, anyone running ANYTHING else doesn't have a chance in hell of placing unless you literally play the lottery. we've all seen ALL of the posts this week from everyone trying to play any other non-contested comp. 

its really, really bad this time.",I've never been more disappointed in a patch...

And by the time I get to the late game, if I get a few good components and/or augments, I stack Varus, Nami or Illaoi and on occasion I can buff all three. Even if I don't get great items for them, the high levels give me some free wins.

TeamfightTactics,"We all know mages are quite broken at this point and every game has at least 2-3 mage players in it and they are consistently in the top 4... I‚Äôve literally seen games where the top 4 were all mage comps, you don‚Äôt even need a strong mage comp to win. Like ‚Äúyou got a Ryze 2 with 3 items? Welcome to your free top 4‚Äù. It‚Äôs pretty dumb just how OP they are. 

Now yea I‚Äôm aware people have had decent luck running assassins into mage, but I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to play assassins constantly to deal with the 1,000,001 people forcing mage Every. Single. Lobby. I just played a game that should have been the easiest first of my life, but took 3rd... not because of my failings or poor choices, but because even though I should have shit on the 2 mage players I‚Äôm the one who got shit on. There is no fucking way my board should ever lose to a mage comp, let alone 6 rounds in a row getting 7-0‚Äôd. 

Here is my ‚Äúgets shit on by mages‚Äù board. Shi 2 with RB, BT, and Titans. Neeko 2 with Sunfire and gargoyle. Sona 2 with IE, JG, BB (didn‚Äôt intend to make her a carry it just worked out that way). Anivia 2 RB, Shojin, chalice. Then Bard. 2, Soraka 2, Nami 2, and Lulu 2. Soraka had a evoker spat and I had Mystic Soul. 

So my final Synergies were 5 mystic, 6 Jade, and 4 evoker. Yeah.. that should ANNIHILATE mages. 4 evokers getting insane amounts of mana from all the mage casts, 3 damage carries including an 8 cost dragon and a 4 cost invoked both 2 star. Plus with 5 mystic everyone on my team had 300 bonus MR. I won streaked almost the entire game until the end where I had 87 health against 2 mage comps and lost 7 rounds in a row to get 3rd. One of them had a Ryze 2 star carry and still destroyed me. 

Mystic should counter mages super hard. Like by design that is the counter to mages. 5 mystic with a fully upgraded board getting beat by Ryze 2 means there is a massive issue with mages. If you are 7-0ing the comp designed to beat you? Idk how that can be ‚Äúok‚Äù. 

As a side note they must have buffed Anivia, because she was PUMPING. Often out damaging everyone. Tomorrow I‚Äôll have to try 3 star Anivia carry.","Ok this is ridiculous at this point, mages hardcore need a hot fix..."

TeamfightTactics,"So the Scalescorn trait gives your units extra magic damage, however half of the Scalescorn units do not deal any magic damage at all. Braum is a nice guardian with a beefy shield, but I don't see how Scalescorn provides any benefits to him. Same for Olaf, he can be a decent carry, but Scalescorn provides no benefits since he doesn't deal any magic damage at all. Only Lillia and Diana seem to benefit a bit from Scalescorn, but Lillia seems to be better with mage and cavalier, while Diana seems to be an annoying tank assassin unit post nerfs. So what's the point? Their trait also ""locks you out"" of dragons, which are pretty powerful units.

It just seems that the entire trait has very minimal scaling and synergy which isn't really worth it over other traits. I guess the only interesting thing is the anti-max health component, but Giant Slayer seems to be a better answer for that.

I heard somewhere that at least one of them was supposed to go somewhat with the traits that you currently have. This may or may not be true as I believe it was on here that I read that. With that being said the past few games that I have played the augments have been completely useless. 

For instance, I just played a game where I had an astral start (nami, illoai, and vlad) so I thought perhaps mages or varus carry. The first augment selection gives me jade heart, shimmerscale heart, and dragonmancer heart. I then reroll and get warrior heart, scalescorn heart, and weakspot. None of the augments helped or had anything to do with the comp that I already had except maybe weakspot.

Something like a really interessing fan made or hourly long self made build. An A tier or B tier comp. Surely you can hit at leats top 4 with these.

TeamfightTactics,"No one plays my comp. Maybe 1 copy is taken of a unit I want to 3*. I can't roll them. It's not possible. I can literally roll 100g and MAYBE find 1 copy. This ruins so many games of mine.

For example just played Scalescorn. Someone had a 2* Olaf, unlucky but I can understand why it's harder to 2* mine. He was sold later on and I was able to 2* mine. The whole game until the last 2 rounds I simply wasn't able to find a Diana to get 4 Scalescorn going. There was 1 copy bought in the whole lobby. 1 copy. Why am I not rolling her on lvl 7?

At one point it even felt like the game wanted to rub it in even further when it offered me a Scalescorn emblem as last augment. Picked the Ornn item one tho because I got tons of Tears, Armor and Rods.

Before anyone says it, I couldn't pivot into mage because albeit no one going for them, I didn't roll them either. I was stuck rolling the same units half the lobby rolled, Revel Cannoneers which I didn't have the items for either.

So again, couldn't find the units no one played but were offered the same units like half the lobby played. Why? Even when they all had early 2* Corki's I was offered one every few rolls..

TeamfightTactics,"There are augments that are an instant pick, there are augments that are an instant reroll, but what caught my interest recently are the augments that seem incredibly bland on first sight but are suprisingly effective.

My pick would be **Metabolic Accelerator**.

&amp;#x200B;

At first glance I underestimated this augment as the 2 health heal at the end of a pvp round seemed negligible and being faster on carousel rounds seemed a bit cheesy. What I did not realise was that it helped me stay relatively healthy while lose streaking and let me transition into a capable board without being at 40 HP at Wolves just because someone hit dragons (god forbid someone hit revel daeja) early or rerolled a 3-Star 1-Cost.

TeamfightTactics,"How did this idea make it all the way into the live game? 

It feels like the sort of thing riot will inevitably show up with statistics to defend by saying AKSHUALLY the data says its win rate is within line for its usage, but that sort of data won‚Äôt account for how binary this item‚Äôs consequences are. 

By that I mean that, because of this game‚Äôs design and the self-balancing nature of comp selection, most matches will have a mixture of teams that rely on tankiness, teams that rely on glass cannon dps/burst, and teams that are balanced between the two with tankiness and DPS

This item‚Äôs function of deleting a target every four seconds will punish a team that relies on tanks far more than it punishes a team that relies on squishy damage dealers. All those tank stats go down the drain in the former case whereas the latter case might actually buy the target more time compared to any other traditional damage item. 

This creates an illusion of balance which creates an illusion of healthy gameplay.

I know the term ‚Äúanti-fun‚Äù has become a meme that gets misused like 99% of the time it gets used, but this item is the epitome of anti-fun gameplay: it is incredibly frustrating for the targets it‚Äôs biased against, it‚Äôs not at all rewarding to ‚Äúoutplay‚Äù for the targets it‚Äôs not biased against, it circumstantially rewards players for ‚Äúoutplaying‚Äù it out of sheer happenstance, and it‚Äôs not rewarding for the user in any case because it really doesn‚Äôt matter what unit it gets put on since it‚Äôs randomly acquired and there‚Äôs no scaling to consider. It might as well be an item that sits on your bench

Do we need to wait for riot to defend this hilariously fresh and relevant execution of the ‚Äúover 9,000‚Äù meme that my boomer dad still loves (did you guys see it deals 9,001 damage?? LOL!!) or can we just skip to the part where they finally admit they were wrong from the start?

I really think there's a build in there somewhere that uses Lillia as a carry, especially in the mage meta that looks to be coming  in but I've not had much success so far. I thought having her as carry backed with a lot of Cavalier/Mystic would give me a strong enough front line that she could just go around booping and mages can't get past it.

Messed around in a game with a Cavalier spat (spat carousel) and +1 cav to easily get to 5 cav. Managed to 3 star my Nunu with really strong items and 3\* my Lillia but even though I had 5 cav/3 mystics I still got destroyed by Mages. This isn't a rant about mages btw I actually quite enjoy them so glad they're seeing some love. So in short, even though my frontline had a rediculous amount of MR it still wasn't enough to hold mages off and my Lillia just can't cut through their frontline.

TeamfightTactics,"I recently ran into an issue with Double Trouble and Daeja and don't know which of the two is bugged. But Daeja's windblasts were not targeting the largest group of enemies as stated in the ability tool tip, but instead whoever was the one being targeted by Daeja's attacks. This happened every single round and ultimately ended up losing me first place, even with Daeja 3, simply because they wouldn't target the group of clumped carries my opponent had every round.

TeamfightTactics,"Hi everyone! So during these last few days I've noticed a gamebreaking bug that has been happening at least once every other game. If you go to your opponents board to play them, rather than staying on your own and eliminate them, you get stuck on their vacant board unable to go back to yours. You can still buy units and level up like you normally would but you're unable to ever go back to your board, even when you try clicking someone else and then clicking yourself. I've also tried relogging and restarting my PC and nothing seems to work. Has anyone else been in the same boat and if so have you found a fix?",Anyone else getting stuck on eliminated enemy boards?

But the only real way to not get top 4 with this augment, is by just trolling imo. All you need to do for crown to work, is hyperroll for some random champs, put them in, and beat everyone until lategame. And lategame your board will be stronger because you got 2 more slots.

Like how can things be so imbalanced that you are forced to play whatever the comp of the week is because they can‚Äôt seem to get the balance right.

Ao-shin 1 with no synergies does 15k damage and beats a board that should shit down it‚Äôs throat. Blowing units out of the water damage wise when it shouldn‚Äôt even be close. Spell sword Mirage, with double trouble. Olaf 3 with cav spat, BT, Mirage spat, Olaf 2, Yone 3 rageblade, JG, Hextech, Yone 2, Nunu 3 with Sunfire, Anima, and Gargoyle, Nunu 2, and Daeja 2. 

Nunu 3 is tanky AF and does good damage with sustain and anti heal, Olaf is tanky, has sustain, and attacks super fast constantly ulting, Yone has tons of damage and sustain and Daeja does decent damage with spell sword. Win streak until stage 5 and then lost 8 rounds in a row. With the 3 stars because they either couldn‚Äôt play the game or couldn‚Äôt get through a single tank. Meanwhile shit like Ao-shin 1 just nukes the entire board. Was good enough for a 5th.

https://lol.qq.com/tft/#/lineupDetail/9821/1/detail

Augments:
Shimmer Heart Crest Crown
Rich get richer is great because you want to be 80 gold later anyway
Pandoras Bench
Level Up

The website shows Early Mid and Final comp which can be inferred with no chinese knowledge and the 1 and 2 on the right show positioning for assassins vs as normal

Items: The website also shows which I probably don‚Äôt need to translate 

Early Transition:
Go for bow to make rageblade because it works well with Dravens axe and Gamblers for money
Senna and Ezreal can item hold if you dont have 3 shimmer
If you have bad items or team you can loss stream for carousel and its even better if you get a spat

Guide: 
After first PVE go 4
Go 6 3-2 or 3-1 if 5 winstreak
If shimmer 3 is Dravens Axe or Gamblers blade then roll for 3 shimmer
If it not then dont worry about 3 shimmer
Go 7 4-1
Go 8 after a few rounds
Roll for Idas or two star ‰πåÈ∏¶(Swain?) 
Get Xayah and stay at 80 gold if you can
Can Two Star Pyke or Bard
Can add Soraka Bard if no 9 shimmer
Around 7-1 you can sell your board minus your five costs and look for 3 star 5 costs
Look for whatever 5 cost the opponent doesnt have and roll 
During PVE roll down 
After PVE see which 5 cost you have more of and sell the ones you have less of
Usually you will have a replicator so its not that hard to hit

Hope it helps, the comp requires a lot of luck and will probably be a fast 8 but it‚Äôs something fun to try",Translated a Chinese guide for Shimmerscale
TeamfightTactics,"Just from my uninformed perspective as a casual reader, I fear that them nerfing the Shimmerscale items that were good, in order to make the other Shimmerscale items more viable, just made shimmerscale less viable overall. I could be wrong though, maybe it'll just be less boom or bust now. 

I think the real big problem with shimmerscale is you never know what variety of item you will get, attack speed, damage, tank, utility, and as of now shimmerscale mostly just fits two main comps: idas/trainer/corki, or slamming a Xayah with guardian, and because of that you almost universally want the damage items, or at least attack speed (maybe excluding diamond hands), so even if these other items are more viable now in terms of strength, are they viable in terms of use? I guess we shall see, maybe it'll make 7/9 shimmerscale more viable, or make shimmerscale playable every game not just when you hit the good items.

TeamfightTactics,"Quick rant, I HATE dodge. Why the hell does  an RNG stat have effectively more value than every other defensive stat in the game. A 1 star Shen that can cast is effectively more useful than a 2 star Ildas with 3 armor  items due to the raw value of just saying ‚Äúnope, nice physical dmg bozo‚Äù. A QSS carry has more chance at survival against a well itemized syfen (titans BT QSS or IE) than a traditional frontline unit would. What irks me isn‚Äôt the fact that dodge is RNG, rather that building dodge can have more of an impact than building armor against high dmg physical targets, OR ones that rely on auto attacks even if they have true damage (looking at you SOY). How dumb is it that your traditionally beefy frontline can be melted by a SOY true damage and 3 hit combo, yet your shitter unit holding the trap claw for your carry can jerk off, dodging and living longer. Don‚Äôt get me started on Shen giving AOE dodge. This budget Naruto ass boy can protect an entire village from a Kansas tornado just by standing there.

TeamfightTactics,,scalescorn stops working if you scalescorn spat a dragon
TeamfightTactics,"Ragewing is so stupid. Think about it:

It's in the very premise: they gain attack speed after they cast an ability, but they can only gain mana with attacks and they don't get base attack speed, so it is very hard for them to cast an ability and thus proc the trait's passive. That would be fine for any carry, because you build Guinsoo on Xayah or Swain and then, the synergy works pretty well actually: the ragewing get's buffed attack speed which helps it stack Guinsoo's faster, which helps him stack faster mana for his next attack. However, on any champions that you're not building Guinsoo's, it's fucking painful. They cast their abilities, actually DO something for the next 4 seconds, but after that they go back to essentially being training dummies.

Ragewing 3 is fine and there are some ways to make it work, but 6 and 9 are basically useless and never worth it, unless you have impecable itemization. All other 5+ synergies are self sufficient, meaning that they got damage and resillience to apply that damage: mages synergize extremely well with guild, bruisers and cavalry; jade has shapeshifters; astral has 2 bruisers which can be easily tripled; whispers synergize well with bruisers; even shimmerscale has powerful tank items and synergizes well with guardian.

With Ragewing 6, you'd need some powerful synergies for your frontline, but you already need to have 6 Ragewings in play, so the only way you could get either bruiser 4, or bruiser 2 + cavalry 2 was to go all the way up to lvl 8 and by then there is no way you wouldn't be dead. Now, guild also has a very disjointed roster, but it is incredibly flexible. Any guild champion provides a buff for the whole team so there is a lot you can do with them and they fit essentially anywhere.

The only trait that appears twice in Ragewing is Dragonmancer, once in Swain, which admitedly is a powerful champion, but the other on in a level 1 frontline champion with no trait that'd help them tank, and even if you were to go swain dragonmancer carry, why would you choose Ragewing? There are 2 dragonmancers in jade and it'd be much more efficient to do a jade dragonmancer build, and EVEN THAT wouldn't be viable.

God forbid you consider Going ragewing 9, because then you DEFINETELY don't have any frontline and you'd have to get Shyvana, which is undisputedly the worst dragon in the game and needs many items to do literally anything. 

So yeah, Ragewing is cringe. Change it.",Ragewing? More like Cringewing.

TeamfightTactics,"Not trying to flame here, just wondering if anyone else is feeling the same way. I genuinely felt like the initial offering was, arguably, one of the strongest openings to any sets in TFT history. But each patch, I feel like the game has just gotten worse and worse.

It feels like virtually every game now is a rush for Astral; usually 2-3 teams running it due to the lack of major limitations on it. Nami is outhealing entire teams with the right items as a 2\* unit.

The cards are so critical to strong team cohesion, but the variance between ""I got a game-altering set of good cards!"" and ""Every card I saw that game totally sucked; I never had a chance"" is a substantial emotion that I didn't feel in previous seasons.

As a result, my playtime has fallen off of a cliff. In the opening 2 weeks, I was playing 3-4 games a day (primarily hyper roll) and now I'm playing 1-2 games a week.

Is anyone else feeling this sort of ""update fatigue""?","Is it just me, or has this update/set gone from ""This is amazing!"" to ""This is so boring and predictable"" with each patch and update this season?"

TeamfightTactics,"I say dumb because yeah it‚Äôs stupid OP but at the same time your odds of hitting are probably 1:1,000,000. I‚Äôm not a normal Jade player, but I got the most high roll start ever so I went for it. By 3-2 I had a Jade emblem on Leona from first augment with sunfire and warmogs (6 Jade did a TON of healing with all that health) and a Varus 2 with Rageblade, BT, and Infiniti force. I substituted Leona 2 for Idas 2 and went fast 9. 

The problem is at 9 I put all my units in selling anything not Jade and I was at 10!Jade with 2 spats on the bench with no option to hit 12. Had I known that was the case I‚Äôd have rolled at 8 and gone a different direction and got an easy top 2 with Shi+Xayaj duo carry, instead of fourth. Oh well lesson learned. 

So as a PSA don‚Äôt go for 12 Jade, you need a VERY specific situation with almost no flexibility. You HAVE to get Silver Jade heart, a Jade emblem, go level 9, and a FON/level up and go to 10/new recruit/cursed crown. So if you don‚Äôt have all 3? Don‚Äôt even think about 12 Jade. The only part not MANDATORY is the silver augment, but then you‚Äôd need to survive until 9 with cursed crown and you‚Äôd need 2 Jade emblems. Relying on a prismatic and gold augments then sourcing a second spat you can‚Äôt make is a long shot to say the least. So really not worth going for.",12 jade is kind of dumb...

Like a tracker like 100hp wins, field a certain champion x amount of time total, etc. It does overlap with missions (but they are purely temperory for xp) 

Since every set changes, challenges might need to be slightly adjusted every set. Which could be a slight problem.   


This isn't the same as just typical stat tracker like lolchess, For example, if we had a damage challenge that check the time in a game you were able to deal 10k damage in a single round etc, getting two three star of a same unit, etc.  


As some may know, every time a league season ends, they have a recap that shows how many time you win with a champion, your most played etc. It would be pretty cool if you were able to see what unit were in the comp you win the most, lose the most, etc.

TeamfightTactics,"Saw the yone item guide post and thought I'd add some positioning tips. I'm just a casual master player so there may be better positioning tips higher ranked players could give. If you know a better strat please share.

Positioning and unit pathing

**Early game positioning:** https://imgur.com/a/WtmQ7e9

Leona and Braum draw aggro from frontline and backline. Aggro changes when Leona or Braum dies. Yone paths to the left and hits a frontline unit. Aatrox steps further than Yone to either hit the same frontline unit or he may aggro onto back line. So there's two buffers you create to protect Yone. Leona and Braum tanking frontline and backline. Then they die and aggro drops, backline units will then usually target Aatrox who will be closer to them or hitting them. Or Yone steps between Leona and Braum which is the best case scenario since he'll more likely receive the Guardian shield. 

Don't put Yone on the 2nd front row. Sometimes units on the 2nd front row can still step up and draw aggro from backline units. The 3rd row makes sure he doesn't draw any aggro. Aatrox on the back row makes sure that other units take up space on the frontline making him walk further to be able to find an open hex to hit a target. He'll usually end up behind the enemy frontline which is key in making Yone survive as long as possible.

**Mid game positioning:** https://imgur.com/a/pBQbuJw

When you level later and find more units, don't put units on the same row as Yone on the same side as him. You'll mess up Yone's path finding since more units will clog the spacing when walking to the frontline. I'd recommend putting other melee units on the same row as Yone on the opposite side so they don't mess up his path finding. Sometimes Yone will even path all the way to the other side of the board to find a target. When you put an Olaf on the opposite side in the same row, this usually deters Yone from walking across the board.

And that's pretty much it. Putting melee carries on the third row and another melee unit behind them causes the backrow melee unit to walk past the enemy frontline making them usually get targeted before your Yone. I'm not an expert on unit pathing or a challenger player or anything so if try it out and see if it works for you. I'm thinking this is at least better than frontline Yone. Also the units used are just for positioning examples.",Tips on melee carry positioning

TeamfightTactics,"Recently I‚Äôve been placing very consistent top 4 by hardforcing a build I came up with.. Basically Bruiser/Astral/Mage.

My end game build consists of:

Illaoi

Traits active are:

Bruiser(6)
Mage (3)
Astral(3)

Itemization‚Ä¶

I have had success itemizing 2*Olaf with Rageblade, and giving 3*Nami AP items. Since Olaf gets the warrior trait, and he doesn‚Äôt need to tank damage, he can slide around pounding everyone (unless the enemy team has AOE CC)

Sometimes I‚Äôll put mage emblem on Ornn so he can ram everyone twice, this also allows me to throw something like Lulu in for the mystic bonus (with all the bruisers, that 50 MR makes a noticeable difference.

TeamfightTactics,"Yone is one of the most undervalued units right now because of how poor the standard itemisation is, so I figured out his Best in Slot (BiS).

In my opinion, Yone has the potential to be one of the most reliable carries to place Top 4 and if you have a sustain augment like Thrill of Hunt then it can even Top 2.

(Findings summarised in these videos: [Individual items](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IfED877SFgM), [Best item combos](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pNeZmrh2NVY), [Best-in-slot for each variation](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pNeZmrh2NVY))

**Assumptions**

* I assume that QSS is always Yone's BiS because CC immunity is essential in the current set, especially for melee carries, and dodge chance is very powerful because, at times, you can just ignore large bursts of damage like from Xayah or Sy'fen.

* I also always assume Yone is 3-star because if he is your carry, he should be 3-starred.

* I did not include crit because this made the calculations non-intuitive and the crit does not proc on his magic damage.

-------------
**Individual item damage increase on Yone**
--------------
****
I began by taking the 5 most suitable damage items and calculated how much each would increase his damage and DPS, which is in the following table.

(Base DPS is 230)

Item | Damage % increase | DPS
:--|:--:|:--:
Titan‚Äôs Resolve | 40.07% | 354
Hand of Justice (Average) | 18.03% | 271
Deathblade | 34.53% | 309
Giant Slayer (‚ÄôAverage‚Äô) | 38.22% | 349
Rageblade | 11.10% | 262

Rageblade's DPS will increase by 6% for every stack. For Giant Slayer, there are calculations that express the lower and upper bounds of the damage increase and the DPS but a single representative number was necessary for simplicity.

You can find [all the math here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zimy1FSP8JMSJEcLml0sDcJFSFjh3OTy/view) and I summarised it in [video form here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IfED877SFgM).

-----------
**Best item combinations on Yone**
---------
****
Next, I took combinations of these items and calculated how much damage would be dealt within 20 seconds of combat (not including traits) and we get the following,

Item combination | Damage in 20 seconds | Autos
:--|:--:|:--:
QSS+Rageblade+GS | 15476 | 40
QSS+Titan‚Äôs+Rageblade | 14266.667 | 40
QSS+Rageblade+HoJ | 11711.667 | 37
QSS+Rageblade+BT | 10720 | 37
QSS+Titan‚Äôs+GS | 10054.1 | 23
QSS+GS+HoJ | 9641.3625 | 22
QSS+HOJ+Titan‚Äôs | 8134.5 | 22

All the [math for this is in this PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17hP5fvOIPJ-AE2ZHflEV5SuzcyesRQt6/view) and summarised in [this video here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/r3-y580wJSY).

-----------
**Best-in-slot Yone for each Mirage variation**
---------
****
Using this information and some reasoning, I concluded Yone's BiS is always QSS and Rageblade but the last item slightly varies for each variation as follows,

Mirage Variation | Last item | Alternative
:--|:--:|:--:
Dawnbringer | Titan‚Äôs Resolve | Giant Slayer
Duelist | Giant Slayer | Titan‚Äôs Resolve
Electric | Don‚Äôt play Yone | N/A
Executioner | Giant Slayer | Titan‚Äôs Resolve
Pirates | Use as item holder | N/A
Spellsword | Rapid Fire Cannon | Giant Slayer
Warlord | Titan‚Äôs Resolve | Giant Slayer

-----------
**Damage dealt by best-in-slot Yone for each Mirage variation**
---------
****
Using the BiS items identified for each variation in the previous table, I calculated how much damage would be dealt at 8 Mirage and 2 Warrior, which is the following table,

Variation | Items | Damage in 20 seconds | Autos
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:
None | None |4520|17
Dawnbringer | QSS+Rageblade+Titan‚Äôs | 14824 | 40
Duelist | QSS+Rageblade+Titan‚Äôs | 33382 | 86
 | QSS+Rageblade+GS | 34624 | 86
Electric | Don‚Äôt play Yone | N/A | N/A
Executioner | QSS+Rageblade+Titan‚Äôs | 26683 | 40 |
 | QSS+Rageblade+GS | 28998 | 40
Pirates | Use as item holder | N/A | N/A
Spellsword | QSS+Rageblade+RFC | 36793 | 52
 | QSS+Rageblade+GS | 33070 | 40
Warlord | QSS+Rageblade+Titan‚Äôs | 18424 | 40
 | QSS+Rageblade+GS | 20880 | 40  


And the [math is in this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BJXFIM__LrGi3sdvxj7jl9Ih0uhfk5Q/view).


-----------
**TLDR**
---------
****


Regardless of variation, **QSS** and **Rageblade** are always best in slot. Yone's passive deals so much damage with attack speed. Zeke's is always great for Yone, except when the variation is Duelist.

Also, this RFC build is kinda fake on Yone, the damage is just coming from the base attack speed multiplier being significantly higher than other builds. Any other build with a Zeke's applied to Yone will outscale it.

Yone wants sustain which you want to get from an augment. But if you do not have any sustain augments then HoJ is an alternative on Yone (HoJ is always better than BT on Yone).


A carry Yone can consistently place Top 4 and if you have a sustain augment like Thrill of Hunt then it can even Top 2.

TeamfightTactics,"So after seeing a video I have been HARDCORE trolling in normal games and getting a lot of 6-7th‚Äôs because I‚Äôm forcing the same comp every game. Best part is? It‚Äôs not even a good comp lol. My last game was a 3rd only because I high rolled my augments. I got Tempest heart, Celestial blessing, and the augment that gives front row middle a ton of AP. I‚Äôve been playing legend Ornn with IE, JG, +1 and standing it next to Neeko with chalices. It‚Äôs awesome because it double dips, I get the chalice bonus on Ornn and Neeko then Ornn gets another 40% of the chalice bonus from Legend (eating Neeko because she‚Äôs got lots of health, maybe there is a better lunch target?) 

I‚Äôm running into a big problem that if I don‚Äôt find a solution to though, I‚Äôll never get a first which is the obvious goal. That‚Äôs sustain... so Ornn ults quick and it 1 shots most units. The problem is I‚Äôm kinda fucked at that point. Ornn isn‚Äôt tanky with that build and 3 completed items get munched on start, so I don‚Äôt have a good second source of damage. With Ornns big mana pool there is a big delay between the first and second cast. 

First idea was either a Shojin or Rageblade to speed up the second cast and maybe get a 3rd, but I don‚Äôt think those would be all that great on Ornn. 

Second idea is life steal. Hoj seems good but the AD is wasted, the AP doesn‚Äôt matter because he‚Äôs already at like 400, and the Omni is whatever and you can‚Äôt count on it rolling double heals. 

That leaves us with Blood Thirster or Gunblade which both have their own merits. The big shield at 40% is obviously nice, but it benefits no one but Ornn. Since he‚Äôs got so much health maybe it‚Äôs the right move though. Gunblade is nice because it keeps up other units too prolonging the fight and letting Ornn cast more. Which is obviously great. 

My question comes down to just HOW gunblade healing works.  I‚Äôll use Ryze as an example.  Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre near the end of a round and you have a Ryze with a gunblade and a ton of mana. When he casts his 7 orbs does all of the healing go to a single unit and over heal them? Or does each orb count as its own and give a bunch of small heals to each low health unit. If that‚Äôs the case then that might be a good idea for Ornn

I‚Äôve tried to watch it but it‚Äôs not easy, so I figured I‚Äôd ask. Thanks in advance.",Gunblade vs Blood Thirster?

TeamfightTactics,"So there are several things that have been limited to Chinese TFT and it seems to be growing, thus my want to create this post. Now they have exclusive SG chibis for Ahri and Lux. I know some people really don't like chibis (I personally generally don't especially price wise) but there is no harm to all of them being available in all servers. Also it isn't just chibis but arenas too.

I don't understand what Riot's goal is. They are only losing money because just because it is exclusive to their servers it doesn't mean the people will want it more. It is limited time that causes these effects. I don't think it is because they want people to change to Chinese servers. As I said they are just losing money because it means less people can buy the product. It also doesn't cause more people to be attracted to TFT because it is specifically in China. If they want people to be attracted to the game due to cosmetics wouldn't a worldwide release bring even more people in?

TeamfightTactics,"Pandora's Curse/Blessing. 

Do ya'll think we could get a hidden augment in TFT if certain situations are met? For started, they would have too occur at the same rate as before, and players would need to choose these two prior to unlocking the third augment. Once this happens players would have the option to select this or just skip it and select anther augment. 

Just a rough idea but I thought of one and then figured it would be too broken before thinking of another option:

**Pandora's Curse**: This would randomly change the items on the entire board, both players would not be able to put items that would combine with the randomized components. 

**Pandora's Blessing**: This would randomly change the amount of gold acquired on the next turn (limited to 0-20) and/or change the gold requirement to level up(excluding Cruel Pact) and this would vary from 2-6 gold. 

There could only be a few of these hidden/hard to acquire augments as too not make it extremely common, maybe these could be considered a level above prismatic?",Pandora's Items + Pandora's Bench = ?

When the game goes to stage 4-1, upgrade to level 7 to find the core unit. Except for high cost units, other units need to refresh to level 2.

When the game is stable, upgrade to level 8 to make daeja reach level 2 and let Lulu play. In the later stage, we will strive to reach level 9 to supplement evoker unit or Yasuo, or choose to make neeko reach level 3. 

**ITEMS**

As for equipment selection, in version 12.13, the traditional mage the comps of traditional mage and varus is popular. because daeja's ordinary attack is weakened. In the game match, I found that morellosonomicon and shiv play better than the traditional attaack equipment, because they do not rely on ordinary attack. In the team combination of jade and lulu,wearing shiv can obtain high attack speed at the beginning of the match, And it can fight against evoker and magic resist tank units. About morellosonomicon, in the combination of shiv and staff, it have obtained 30 initial mana values. Choosing it can make enemy units reduce the amount of treatment faster and apply it to rear row units,Burning injury and 30 basic ability power are good choices also.

Compared with the high mirage team combination, it has better tank units and higher attack speed. Thank you for reading the text.","Team introduction, a team combination of daeja with jade"

TeamfightTactics,,Bugged Pyke Ulting Voli 3* Seven Times In A Row
TeamfightTactics,"Hey,

I recently played a game and wonder how the Guild specific Augment ""Gear Upgrades"" works. It reads

""Guild champions holding an item gain 35 Armor and an additional 200% of their base Guild Bonus. Gain a Twitch.""

Guild meanwhile reads:
""Grant a unique bonus to your team; Guild allies gain double the amount. Increases for each Guild member in play.""

Now I placed a Talon with 2 additional Guild members some item on the field. His base guild bonus is +14 AD, so due to Guild he should have +14 AD*2*1.4 (Guild members gain double the bonus and Guild increases it by 140%). Then my Augment should also be enabled due to Talon having an item so it should be +14AD*2*1.4*2 or+14AD*2*1.4+14 AD*2, depending on how it is calculated. 

My Talon however only had a bonus of +28 AD. So I tried placing a Talon without an item. He also had +28AD.

Even if my calculations are wrong somewhere, both Talons can not have the same Bonus AD, since one held an item and the other didn't.

Am I understanding this Augment wrong somehow?","Possible Bug with Guild augment ""Gear Upgrades""?"

I had about 40\~ LP, took a break for about a week, logged in yesterday (day before patch 12.13) and still had 40\~ LP, but was warned via dialogue box that I would decay rating if I didn't play a ranked match. I played the ranked match, got 4th and went up to 50\~ LP. I logged off and logged in today (patch 12.13 release day) and my LP is now 0. When I logged in I was prompted again that I could decay rating if I didn't play a ranked match (same dialogue from the day before, as if I never played my game). 

This is in Master league NA. Did it happen to anyone else? TFT is basically a gambling game with time as the main currency, and it feels like I had some currency stolen! All of the other players I check have the same LPs as before patch day, so I don't understand why this happened.

So it breaks my mind as to how they thought it was ok for nidalee and varus to be so strong when they‚Äôre so easy to consistently 3 star at 3-1 and 4-1 respectively. 

You don‚Äôt even need specific augments. 

With nidalee, she causes such a huge hp swing for you stage 3 (by hp swing I mean she gives u a win streak whilst dealing almost 10 to everyone else) and even early stage 4. This often gets you a top 4 just from the hp. U‚Äôd think that they learnt their lesson from the other 1 cost rerolls and would have prob made nidalee a viable comp only with good augments, but nope, you can play her with almost any augment. 

Varus on the other hand wins out from 4-1.

How have they not made any changes Reckless Spending from the patch.

1. The Augment doesn't even work in stage 9 as you can no longer level (which is arguably when it would most useful in the end game)
2. Burning 6 gold a turn for 50% damage for shimmerscale champs where half of them don't even do damage. i'm looking at you Idas, at least grant a shimmerscale emblem or if Shimmerscale is active let the whole team benefit from it. 
3. It averages a 5.80 by far the worst augment in the game and being offered it should be illegal b/c you are being offered 2 augments while everyone else in the lobby is being offered 3. 

I'm sure there are many other reasons why there should be changes made to this augment... I understand we need to nerf the strong augments double trouble etc... but going into 2-1 and you see Reckless spending, you just got mortdogged",Reckless Spending how was this not addressed in the patch

TeamfightTactics,"So I‚Äôve been having fun playing Elise lately since not a lot of people play her and I was trying to figure out some sort of a combo of items that would work well besides the standard IE, JG, +1.  6 whisper is the norm but I wanted to go away from the standard. If you want a TLDR: stick to the norm. 

I figured 3 AE Elise 3 should be godlike. That‚Äôs 90AP to start and 60AP every 5 seconds much more than anything whispers is going to give. To say the least, not good lol. Ended up going 5th which was shocking to me honestly. Elise just didn‚Äôt have the power she needed. 

Her problem was early in the round. I figured 190AP would hit about as hard as IE+JG since that doesn‚Äôt add much AP and doing double damage would be close. She really struggled to actually get kills. There was a few fights where the enemy was a stall board and she could clap hitting for 4K at the end of the round but that was the exception not the rule. 

I ended up 5th because I had too much invested into her and she sucked. I thought id get 1st easy because my board was STACKED but playing down her was no bueno. My final board was Gnar 2, Neeko 2 with anima, sunfire, spark, shyv 1 with Dclaw, Nidalee 2, Elise 3 with 3 Arch‚Äôs, and Swain 3 with Rageblade, GS, and QSS. I figured if Elise didn‚Äôt carry Swain would, but I was wrong.  Even had beasts den as an augment. 

So for those who appreciate the spider like I do, don‚Äôt try and reinvent the wheel.  I think the best boards for her are still 6 whisper duo carry with Syfen or 6 Jade 4 shape duo carry with Shi and using Neeko in both comps as your tank. The only problem which is really a blessing is that the dragons can and often times do outshine the spider and make her feel like the backup carry. 

It still feels so great to watch the rage of someone who 7-0‚Äôs you except your spider with Thrill IE, JG, and AE and she drops to 1 shot their units 1 by 1. Overtime hits and her damage gets doubled and she 1 shots a 2 star dragon.

Somehow 2 incredibly high health people (im talking 90+ hp at 7-1) get multiple 1-2 unit losses against each other and probably only have 1 life each at 8-1

The change is being done because of people hostaging games with soraka 3, but guess what? There's literally a button that says ""I dont want to play this match anymore"" aka the surrender button. Now in double up this situation becomes trickier, since what if your teammate votes no? Then you're stuck in the game with them, and thats why this change is fine for double up, but for standard mode? This change realistically wont do anything but remove some of the fun things you can do by making games go for a really long time, and since you can leave at any time you want, it's not like you can get hostaged.

I am playing TFT since years and I have a big problem with the actual meta. I usually dont play the T1 builds and try to play with the Champions I get in the combination with augments. But now it seems to be impossible to play creative cause Syfen and Shi Oh Yu are too strong. 

I think its far to easy to get them cause they are 4 drops and people start hyperroll on lvl 6 or 7. Even if I winstreak until that phase and go on Level 8 I loose vs the Dragons cause they have too much health, heal and they can just dodge my tanks. 

So I am wondering why riot did not just make all dragons legendary 5 drops. This would make it balanced again. I have absolutely no issue with Shivana, Aurelion and Ao Shin. But these dragons dont get played often anymore cause the 4 drop dragons are just stronger than them and far easier to get. So I think there is no real diversity and balance in the actual meta.

TeamfightTactics,"To preface this discussion, I want to state that this is my opinion regarding the newest set and it definitely is not definitive. I love this game, TFT has had a massive impact on me, pushing me to learn game design and peruse it professionally. I mean the best for Teamfight Tactics with this post.

&amp;#x200B;

This new set in all honestly is one of the most impressive sets so far in my opinion, almost every trait feels great to use with a few notable exceptions. The maps and new little legends are well designed and feel exceptionally polished. And most importantly, the game feels extremely well-balanced\*.

Playing this new set has been an absolute joy, albeit a bit more specialized. I feel as if a lot of the newer traits feel very active and push you to manage your board and general play more actively. Of course, there are the more simple traits like Cannoneer, Cavalier, Guild, Mystic, and Swiftshot but the overall game feels more like the matches are interactive and in the players control. That leads me to the second point, the treasure dragon is downright incredible. 

I love the treasure dragon so much, it gives you the ability to get that one extra component you need to finish off your build on your hyper carry or give yourself a spatula to cap off a trait on your team or even just get a glove to toss onto a random unit. I cannot express in words how fun treasure dragon has been and it just makes the game feel as if it's more in my control. I've gotten hooked real hard on TFT since this set has dropped and it has convinced me to take ranked more seriously and try to introduce friends to the game. However, that leads into one of the major gripes with this set, it is hard to get into.

Now, this might just be bad teaching on my part, but I felt that Set 6 was one of the easier to-teach sets because it had a very beginner-friendly trait: Yordles. Usually, when I would take the time to play with a friend for a few days to teach them how TFT works, id start off by teaching them how to play Yordles. Yordles was a simple easy to grasp trait that set the goal for the player to pick up Yordles on the way to 50 gold, then once reaching above 50 gold, rolling as long as you don't go below 50. When looking at Set 7, there is no real equivalent to an easy to learn set. 

I've tried teaching people using cosmic but having to learn how to stretch out into mages (Either by picking up a Sylas or whatnot) and understanding how to correctly play off Aurelion Sol correctly with Mana items is a nightmare. Not to mention that Cosmic feels terrible early on. It feels almost impossible to find success on Cosmics for a newer player that doesn't know when to roll, when to level, and when to play for econ.

I've tried teaching using Dragonmancer but the reliance on a single hyper carry makes it hard to explain how to dodge a thresh hook or avoid assassin, and that's not bringing up how you need to know how to build correctly in specific ways to make them work (With the exception of Lee Sin). For example, I had a friend who was learning TFT that put AD items on Swain because he was ranged and they thought ranged characters need AD, Dragonmancer is definitely an easier trait to play around but it really isn't a great starting point for a new player because of the quirks of the characters (that are worth using Dragonmancer's Blessing on). 

Then there is Jade, which I feel is definitely easier to play but requires good management of not only your jade statue(s) but also your gold and XP. In addition, stretching out to other trats depending on your items and matchups is really important, while on the surface its easy, it really is hard to ease somebody into it since in requires strong fundementals which a new player just wont have.  


(There's also sins but I'm not going to like sins aren't that crazy strong without Sy'fen/Other Carries + sin spat shenanigans imo)  


Minor gripe is the dragon models, while I understand that Mort Dog (one of the best devs ever) said that there were time constraints that made it impossible to make new models for all of then, Dae'ja is one of the biggest offenders (no pun intended). She looks like a frontline and it really doesn't suit her backline playstyle. In addition, since you build attack speed with rageblade, she looks really goofy using Galio's Q animation for her autos at high speeds.  


One last minor gripe is whispers, it doesn't feel very impactful (even though it definitely is), maybe its a lack of feedback but it always feels kind of boring to use.   


Overall this set is incredible and honestly one of the best ones if not the best one yet! I'm addicted to the game (again) and I've been loving every moment of it. I wish it was a bit more beginner friendly, but hey, I'm still happy with the state of this deck. I love playing it with family and friends. and I cant wait to see the future TFT holds. Thank you, TFT team!

I call them the Google comps cuz it's textbook shit. Like why even play if you just gonna do it exactly the same without no thought to augments, traits, other comps etc? I thought Riot was gonna fix these traits and comps to make others viable?

 Of course any conp.is great late game but with augments and treasure dragon and astral üí© out almost free units, that's all TFT has turned into is who can make the best volilord or roll astrals the fastest or put a rageblade on corki first.

TeamfightTactics,,"I've been forcing Shimmerscale every game for almost 2 weeks now, this was by far my most highroll game ever!"
TeamfightTactics,"So I placed first in a match solely because I picked the last Stand augment for my second slot. This augment grants you immunity from death when your hp reaches 0 for the first time, and then your team receives 200 hp/20 magic resist/20 armor/20% omnivamp. Insane stats if you can make it to the top 3 and just need that extra survivability. My comp was 4 revel 4 cannoneer game with a 3 star sona.

I just think it's so cool how many interesting augments there are. I've never heard of this augment or even seen it and I'd say I play quite a bit.

TeamfightTactics,"I cannot wait for this set to end. In each game I am struggling to find a nice and fun combination of units to play, and then there is always this guy that will just play a 1 unit team and win the game for some reason. 

You are not capable of using your brain to think of a nice combo of units? No problem, just drop a lvl 2 syfen in (or volibear dragonmancer), and there is nothing else you need to do apart of throwing a couple of supports to heal and buff you.

It doesn't matter if I have the perfect combo in the board. If you have a lvl 2 dragon and I don't, your chances of winning immediately increase by 40-50%.

This set is for those that want to play around 1 overpowered unit, which is pretty shit imo. Can't wait to go back to healthy balanced combo synergies.",Set 7 is extremely bad

I finished 6th here with ragewing 9, dragonmancer 3. Cybernetic Uplink 2, Ragewing heart, scorch.

The fights would start and my frontline would hold until Shyvana ascended. While she's flying, it looks like she's not doing anything (?) and basically my entire team melts in that time except for Swain, and then it would be 2v6 by the time she lands and they would fight valiantly and lose.

TeamfightTactics,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

First I want to thank the developer team for a pretty functional game. It's really fun to be playing a double up game where not only some lucky kid hits sy'fen 2 at stage 3 that clearly is balanced and fun to play against. But also the shop bugs where you can't refresh it and can't buy anything for the last 6 rounds :). Wouldn't you have fun playing this ???

&amp;#x200B;

Well so the story is I was playing double up with a friend in a low elo plat game. We were winning hard and so healthy. He was hitting all his champs for his assassing olaf comp. I was so happy and having fun. Until this guy hits sy'fen 2 so early while I was playing it. No problem I'll pivot. Then this guy manages to hit sy'fen 3 with pandora bench which is the most balanced augment. At the end (before last 6 rounds) we were at 40hp and they were at 18 which clearly is a top 1 since his teamate was playing swiftshot and loses very quickly before sy'fen 3 comes and 9v1s. at this round my shop freezes and I can't refresh. So I didn't spend any money and thought it will be fixed next round. Didn't work so I disconnected and reconnected. Nope still bugged. I can't even buy the champs I have in the bugged shop. So I was stcuk with the same bugged shop for 6 rounds and couldn't do much. This made me weaker than his friend and they managed to win the game with 1hp. Also they hit 2hp and then 1p :) very balanced mechanisme. So I had 6 rounds of pseudo afk and contested by a lucky kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good job developers for the balanced unbuggeed game that is so fun to play. 

&amp;#x200B;

TeamfightTactics,"My friend and I usually havign a lot of fun playing double up but since Astral Emblem strat come online, people keep spaming it left and right.

It's just so sad that every single lobby have people trying this and more than 50% of time they end up going 1st because they hit thevemblem and manage to survive since other player just feed the unit to other.

This make going 1st is about Astral Emblem which I think it's not fun at all for people to contest who is the luckiest one?

Today, I literally found exact same duo that spamming this strat 3 game in a row snd they got 1st for two game.

Now, no matter how good my comp is, it's kinda meaningless if other get the emblem. Only get 2nd at best.

With all of this, it's kinda make me and my duo can't enjoy double up like before.

Is it just me being satly about the emblem or the other feel the same?

or is there any counterplay to this or I just need to move on and pray that this guy die early?

TeamfightTactics,"Where are the playable 2 cost units in this set? Barely any of the 2 costs actually feels worth it let alone is able to be played as a carry. 

Yone is legit the only 2 cost you can potentially play as a carry when the stars allign and you get a good mirage trait, good items and suitable augments and even then you are probably better off just hoping to get Daeja. Like why is there just one 2 cost that potentially (!) doesnt feel like it's either a filler/traitbot or utility.

Mind you I dont expect 2 costs to be anything crazy but that you just cant feasibly build any comp around a 2cost carry makes the game feel dull imo. Especially Jinx, Kayn, Yone and Tristana look like units that you SHOULD be able to turn into your main carries but you just cant.

It feels like every lobby just devolves into however finds his dragon first or gets rolling with 1star reroll comp early (of which are a few still around) goes top4 because there is just no 2cost carry comps around. This is even more amplified by not having exactly a plethora of 3 cost carry comps either. Volibear was quite frankly broken OP for a short while and now rests in piss, Lee 3 is hilarious if you manage to pull it off but good luck getting him 3 since a number of comps wants to play him as 2star. Meanwhile Swain, Nunu and Ryze are only viable carries once in a blue moon when everything alligns perfectly for you and Olaf is also only good with an assassin spat anymore. 

Where is the diversity in this meta? In Set 6 you could play so much stuff centered around carries from basically all cost-tiers and this set you either high roll a 1cost comp or find your Dragon/4cost carry on the 3-5 all in or you are basically fked. This set just currently feels so limited and it sucks out the fun for me tbh.

TeamfightTactics,"I'm seeing a lot of posts about someone highrolling a Xayah, Corki, or Dragon early in the game or that so and so needs buffed because it's not as strong as something else.

For me, when TFT is at it's best is where you cannot force something every game and I believe that's where we are at right now. Not every composition should have the chance at hitting #1.

For me what separates the really good players is that they know when they are not going to win the lobby and pivot to a comp that can hit at least #4.

I feel like a lot of people just know what's popular like Syfen or Xayah. If they hit what they need early, they understand how to build. But if they get shit rolls, they still try to force that #1 comp and end up coming in 7th or 8th because someone else has already hit the nuts.

When I stopped worrying about #1 or #2 and started focusing on how to consistently land at least #4, I started climbing and enjoying the game much, much more.

Are you going to place #1 with Mages over and over again? No, but that doesn't make them bad. If you pivot to an uncontested Mage comp and land #3 or #4 and gain LP, that's a good game and I think a lot of people lack this mindset.",Being happy with a #4 placement will make you a much better TFT player

Some games I'd go 1st and others 6th-8th. 

Then I finally broke and looked on this sub and the competitive sub. I found out people were complaining how this meta is so dumb you just fast level and forget about econ then rng for a lucky dragon. And I thought ""wait what? Is that what people are doing?""

So here I was in Plat 3, queue up for a game and was planning to just level as fast as I can without caring for econ. And what do you know, it actually worked lmao. 10 games later and I'm in Diamond just leveling to 5 at 2-2 if possible and 7 as fast as I can without a care in the world for econ.

TeamfightTactics,"# Comp Coach #1 - Improving Community-created Comps

Greetings Reddit! If you don't know me, I've been writing TFT guides for a very long time now, and for this post, I've decided to check out some guides made by players. I want to start a little series to review some guides made by the community.

I found these guides browsing through the [Top](https://app.mobalytics.gg/tft/community-comps) and [New](https://app.mobalytics.gg/tft/community-comps?cs_type=new) sections of Mobalytics Community Comps. Also, if you have guides you want me to take a look at, feel free to link them in the comments or send me a message. Next patch, I might do another post like this, so having some guides to look at would be great.

For the most part, my goal isn't to force the player to play meta but more so help them better execute the concept they're going for  Hopefully this sort of content is interesting, so let's get started.

# 1) EZ WIN Full Astral - By Apo11oTTV

[Link to Guide](https://app.mobalytics.gg/tft/comps-guide/2Bd0BzzotWkAX2edexKuziQfCLE)

First up, let's take a look at this Guide for 9 Astral. 9 Astral in this current patch is definitely more of a meme comp, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.

https://preview.redd.it/l13mmmuwkea91.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77048fdb9a939821ed1127107254d19d2d310049

Checking out the description, I'm already a bit confused on the emphasis to rush level 5. As far as I can tell, there is no benefit to rushing level 5 compared to leveling up normally.

Secondly, there is definitely a lack of traits in this comp. While I understand it is an Astral 9 comp, you can still use things like Mage Emblem to get 3 Mages in. Having only Astral and Bruiser in the comp doesn't feel like it will go very far.

Lastly, there is an emphasis on Nami items, but once again, there is no Mages. Even if Nami were to be the main carry, there is no further explanation on the best units to itemize next. Every unit having 3 items is nice to show what items are good, but also doesn't do anything for me as it doesn't show what priority is good.

https://preview.redd.it/vx4ar13hlea91.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8604ca3a83f690f0274c7d12f328c30aa392a199

Taking a look at the game plan, there's nothing too surprising here. Once again for the early game, there is an emphasis to rush level 4. Rushing level 4 is basically choosing to pre level or not, but that should be done only if you can win streak. If you level and lose your streak, you will just bomb your economy. And this comp definitely needs economy.

The mid game makes sense as you want to fit in 6 Astral, and eventually fit in Aurelion Sol at level 8. However, here would be a good point to note that you can use something like a Mage (like Sylas) at level 7 before finding Aurelion Sol. That will give you 3 Mages and be strong until you reach 9 Astral.

https://preview.redd.it/zak5xzlhlea91.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ac2b2c9b84d84648b020d8cf27b6ad7443642b

This is where I get a little more confused about the item priority. If Nami is noted as important to itemize, why is Tear so low? Maybe rushing Infinity Edge on Nidalee is the idea here. Followed by Warmog's for a frontline unit. Then followed by Tear for Nami.

That's the idea that I get from reading this, and maybe that is the intention, but it doesn't come off clear and easy for the reader I would say.

Lastly, the 3 recommended Hextech Augments being Astral is quite simple and self explanatory. It would be nice to see some other stand out augments for this comp. Trade Sector for example is a definite standout. Even something like Mage Heart can be big for Nami.

**Final Words:** Overall, this comp definitely seems to be more of a meme guide, but can definitely use some improvement. Spamming this in normal games can be fun, but having some extra depth in the guide can make the comp more consistent, and result in more games where you actually enjoy the comp.

# 2) tankbird - By nightgodder

Let's take a look at this next comp which is less of a meme comp, but is not a top meta comp. Legends have seen quite a bit of play before the hotfix, so players should be somewhat used to how to play Legends.

This comp wants to use Anivia as the tank alongside 4 Legend, which is fine, but I would consider not ideal. Also since Anivia is a tank, there is less need for Evoker, but I still think the comp can be improved.

Mobalytics already has a [Cavalier Legend](https://app.mobalytics.gg/tft/team-comps/cavalier-legend) comp, which I would already consider an upgrade to this comp.

However, since this comp wants to use Anivia as a Tank, I will not change that fact. The other Cavalier comp uses Ornn Cavalier to buff up Neeko, which then gets absorbed by Volibear. This results in a HUGE amount of HP, Armor, and MR. As I go through this comp, I will let Anivia remain the tank, but give my suggestions.

https://preview.redd.it/x97sksgklea91.png?width=581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf021c845c95a623ba2bbcca1dd6ddd9ebdec6a

First off, looking at the two Jade units, (Ashe and Karma), I already think they should be replaced. They provide 3 Dragonmancer, but that only gives a small HP and Ability Power buff to Volibear. While this is nice, I think the combination of Neeko and Gnar is just too powerful to not use.

Furthermore, by adding in Neeko to be absorbed by a Legend, you can save Hecarim from being absorbed, which is good because he provides good utility during a team fight.

So let's say we replace Ashe and Karma with Gnar and Neeko, what should the formation look like now?

[This is my improved formation](https://preview.redd.it/76lvyn5olea91.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebbdb3fcdd1204820632782c8e1e58aac6d0b89d)

With Neeko, we can further buff up Anivia a ton. Neeko will copy Anivia's Health and Resistances (which are huge from Cavalier) and be absorbed right into Anivia to double those stats. Neeko will also copy Ability Power from Anivia, and feed it right back with 40% to Anivia through Legend.

I also threw another Cavalier Emblem on Ornn just in case you're able to get another one.

I feel as though this variation, over the Ashe and Karma variation, is a huge improvement to the tankbird. Hecarim also stays around and provides utility which is great to have.

https://preview.redd.it/o7imcdeqlea91.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3782fb3b15dc482df5269eec96138f55b571a16f

Taking a look at the gameplan, I wouldn't change too much. The early game is definitely fine to either try to win streak or to just lose streak with something like Shimmerscale.

The Midgame I also think is very appropriate. Roll at 7 to find Anivia and Volibear to stabilze is fine. Also at this point, running the units like Karma and Ashe are also fine as Dragonmancer is still solid in this early to mid game.

https://preview.redd.it/yzztnxwqlea91.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=accf03daf8fb3558c94663f90003b50817ea30cc

Volibear definitely is the more reliable carry in this comp, but since the comp is called tankbird, I want to prioritize Anivia items for the sake of it.

https://preview.redd.it/p62tpiirlea91.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a72c18dd4a8133a02bb9ac5dbd167d10a1b82d4f

Lastly, the Carousel Priority makes sense, there's nothing too surprising here as the items indicate a priority toward Volibear's items and then Anivia's.

However, there is no mention of Hextech Augments for this guide, which I find unfortunate. The easiest ones to pick are things like: Cavalier Crest, Cavalier Crown, or even Cavalier Unity.

With Cavalier unity, none of your units need the Cavalier Emblem, but you won't be able to reach higher tiers of Cavalier, which is important for the bonus resistances.

Other than the Cavalier Augments, there's also things like Trade Sector for an economy trait, or Tri Force for a combat trait.

**Final Words:** Overall, this comp shows a lot of potential, and can be quite the fun alternative to the usual Volibear Dragonmancer comp. I just made some improvements that I thought could make the comp more capped without being too unrealistic.

# Conclusion

And that wraps up my review on some of the community comps. It's been great watching the quality of guides come out from players, and I had fun giving some pointers on random comps I found. There's room for a lot of creativity in these guides, and it's definitely starting to show.

If you're interested in getting me to review your comp, you can comment down below. Depending how much time I have, I can give some basic pointers in a reply, or I'll save your comp for another Comp Coach article. I'll likely do another one of these for the next patch. I can also ask some of our Challenger players to also help with the review too, so don't be shy.

While some comps are still fun and meme comps, even those can be fun to try out in normal games to have fun. Hopefully this inspires some of you guys to write your own guides or to improve your current guides. Thanks for reading.",Comp Coach #1 - Improving Community-created Comps (9 Astral and Tank Anivia)

TeamfightTactics,"**TL;DR Bye Soraka 3, Bye Astral Emblem**

Hi! It's me again, with Subreddit ""Patch"" 1.2.

So in the last subreddit update ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/vmfnsb/subreddit_patch_11_set_faq_and_death_to_the/)) I said that crown of champions posts would be gone, as well as a couple of other things. A few things happened:

\- People who wanted these sorts of repetitive topics removed didn't seem to realize my post existed

\- The number of crown of champions posts proceeded to double (?) in the days following so I guess they didn't see my post either

\- At least one person sent us an angry modmail complaining that their 9 shimmerscale post got removed

Hopefully a more direct title does the trick this time around?

\-----------------------

Onto today's major updates:

**Questions about Soraka 3 are no longer allowed** \- people keep asking why their units get insta one-shot or that their opponent's health suddenly shot up and...that's in the unit/trait description.

**3 star with Astral emblem posts are no longer allowed** \- there have been multiple posts per day about that too.

I'll be putting some blurbs about those in the [set FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/wiki/faqset7) (also in the sidebar) in a few hours when I get off work.

**I've also decided to explicitly** **create Rule 14** (will be there in a few hours as well) which will cover these sorts of posts. I previously put them under Rule 6 / Rule 10, but lots of people didn't notice, so putting them as their own rule should increase visibility and decrease future workload removing said posts. Going forward, for each set, Rule 14 is tentative to be enforced starting **2 weeks after set release**, which should give both time to figure out which mechanics are going to fall under that bucket and reasonable breathing room for new players. Stuff introduced in the midset will be subject to Rule 14 2 weeks after midset release.

\-----------------------

To answer some questions people have recently asked about moderation:

**Do we actually remove posts?**

\- Yes, that being said we are *comically* undermanned, so sometimes we're slow to the punch, and mods having a surge of IRL obligations (e.g. me for the last month) doesn't make it remotely better. Also if you could see some of the removed posts and comments...

**There's this rulebreaking post/comment...**

\- Report it - Some folks have recently gotten into the habit of commenting something like ""mods pls remove"" under a rulebreaking post without actually reporting it - just ends up making it harder for us.

**Unpaid internet janitor KEKW**

**-** Once upon a time Reddit hooked me up with a year of free Duolingo Plus, so that's very slightly paid internet janitor KEKW to you ;)

TeamfightTactics,"In his recent stream, Mortdog rolled an early Astral emblem and played around three starring all of his Astrals. He hit 3\* on all of them, and found a bard off carousel to put his Astral emblem on. After finding 7 Bards via Astral shops, he rolled another Astral shop which contained no bards.

&amp;#x200B;

While the chat believed other players had taken all remaining Bards from the pool, Mort explained that no, that was no the only way to get an empty Astral shop.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

(Stream here if you want to watch: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1523956469](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1523956469))

&amp;#x200B;

Relevant part of the video is 1:55:00 - 1:59:10

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**How Astral Actually Works**

(According to Mortdog)

&amp;#x200B;

Every 5th shop you will get an Astral shop. This shop will pre-roll a number of ""guaranteed"" astral units: anywhere from 3 to 5. For each of the ""guaranteed"" Astral units, the shop will roll according to your shop odds, and decide what cost unit you will get. If there is at least one available Astral unit of that rarity, then you will see an Astral unit for that spot in the shop. If there is no Astral unit of the cost available in the pool, it will reroll the unit cost for that shop slot and check again for available Astral units. It will reroll the unit rarity 100 times before giving up and giving you no Astral unit for that shop slot.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis**

The difference between actual guaranteed Astral shops and the way Astral actually works is, in most cases, insignificant. When you put an Astral emblem on a 5 cost at level 7, it starts to matter a lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

At level 7, there is a 1% chance to hit a 5 cost unit. This means that if you have an Astral emblem on a 5 cost and 3\* all other Astrals, there is a 0.99\^100 = 36% chance that you will receive no Astral unit in a ""guaranteed"" Astral unit slot. This brings down the expected number of that unit that you will hit from 4 per Astral shop down to 2.56.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Is Mortdog wrong?**

&amp;#x200B;

Ahh, the hubris! Clearly I know more about the game than the Lead Set Designer! Just hear me out. The math strongly implies that Mortdog's explanation of how Astral works is wrong. Or, more likely, he was just wrong that about others not having taken all the Bards out of the pool for his game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In his stream, Mortdog hit not 1, but 2 completely empty Astral shops. The odds of this happening at level 7 in general are extremely low:

&amp;#x200B;

1/3 \* Odds of hitting none for a 3 Astral shop + 1/3 \* Odds of hitting none for a 4 Astral shop 1/3 \* Odds of hitting none for a 5 Astral shop

&amp;#x200B;

= (0.33)(0.36\^3) + (0.33)(0.36\^4) + (0.33)(0.36\^5)

&amp;#x200B;

= 2.3%

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, Mortdog had previously been running Bard, so his 5 cost odds were at 4%. This lowers the odds of hitting a completely empty Astral shop to 0.00016%. And he would have had to hit this twice. Safe to say that didn't happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have a suspicion that Astral shops are bugged to not take into account changes to shop odds. I hit Astral emblem on Soraka with high end shopping the other day putting my 5 cost odds at 1%, but I hit 3 completely empty Astral shops. I double checked, and nobody else had any Sorakas. This should be extremely unlikely to happen. If Astral shops are bugged to not take not take into account changes to shop odds, this would make Mort's situation much more likely.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It is also possible that Astral shops do not reroll up to 100 times for each ""guaranteed ""unit slot, but rather total. This would make it much more likely to hit empty Astral shops. Mortdog didn't really clarify, so if yall have a better interpretation of what he said in the stream I'd love to hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading. As somebody who loves the 3\* 5 cost fantasy with Astral emblem, I figured I'd share this since it can have a big impact on your chances of hitting that before dying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Astral shops can be empty of Astral units when you put an Astral Emblem on a 5 cost with 1% shop odds, since Astral rolls shop odds first and only rerolls 100 times to try to hit an Astral.",The secret of how Astral emblem ACTUALLY works

Of course this is Double Up, so there was a chance his mate would lose fast and therefore they could stil lose. However, his mate had 8 Mirage Dawnbringer Daeja, making it basically impossible to beat, despite them being 1 HP at the moment they hit Bard 3.

&amp;#x200B;

We thought it was over and we had to take our second. I thought of maybe delaying his cast with shroud or zephyr, but again, this wouldn't buy enough time.   


I faced his mate, waiting for the inevitable Bard 3 teleporting onto my board. However it didn't happen. I was flabbergasted, looking at the HP of the Bard 3 guy going 0. I tried to figure how he could possibly lose a round.   


Well, the answer is the gentleman that went 8th here. He was playing sin olaf.. with Qss. Olaf is unaffected by Bard ult and presumably continues to solo the rest of the board, because it was steaming hot garbage. Thank you for the first, kind stranger!

TeamfightTactics,"So i just wanted to ask about something i experienced earlier today.

Bit of info, im playing the Garena LOL (i know its sad), so im not sure if some functions of the league client elsewhere will be available for me.

&amp;#x200B;

But i was playing a ranked match, and it came down to top 3. Was playing a Mirage comp and noticed that the other player has a Yasuo 3. They had two Astral emblems, and seems to get the Yasuo 3 there. Everybody was at sub-20 hp, so it was very possible to get knocked out with one loss.

I knocked out the other player and was scouting the Astral player and saw that they sold the Yasuo 3 and made a Soraka 3 instead. So i out damaged the heals and won, but what i noticed that their hp is now 66 (post damage) and got confused since i thought that i would have killed them already. Next round i saw them frantically levelling up and making a Zoe 3 now, so i assumed that im done for. But i seem to be winning, at least at the start, before my entire team die at the same time (no skills at the screen at the time) and i saw the player's hp go from 66 to 100 right before it pans for the win.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this was just a visual bug or smth. So i was wondering if any of you guys encountered this as well. If there was a cheat like this i doubt it would stay hidden.",Possible Cheat?
TeamfightTactics," So I've been playing TFT casually since set 1 and only really grind during set 4,6,7 (I'm still a high school student, so there is not much time for gaming, unfortunately).   


When I play casually, e.g. stacking with my friends or just trying different comps, I have hit Gold consistently across all sets. When I start taking the game more seriously, I have always hit Dia 1 across two servers (SEA and NA) after 70 games.   


From my judgement of my gameplay, I think I usually do pretty well in the fundamentals e,g, positioning, econ, lobby analysis, etc. Tbh, It makes me feel that I'm pretty good at this game. However, when I try to learn more by watching streamers, I can see the vast knowledge gap between those players and myself. There are moments when they do things I never even thought possible. It makes me question: ""Am I good at this game, or am I just a bit better than the ""noob"" players?""   


Therefore, what are your takes on what ""being good at TFT"" actually means? Is it just the rank, the LP or the skills, and techniques in your gameplay or what else?","How to consider a player to be ""good at TFT""?"
TeamfightTactics,"Does anyone know how Anivia's spell is coded to work? When I play her, she consistently shoots her storm with the enemy champ on the edge vs having the enemy champ in the center. It's written as ""...summons a prismatic storm around her target"" which seems to indicate it should be actually around the target vs adjacent to it. Maybe I just don't understand how the spell works, but she would be SOOO much better if she actually hit her target (or ideally entire mobs but that may not be intended).",Anivia Targeting

TeamfightTactics,"So I was playing some double up with my buddy yesterday. We were doing pritty good until we suddenly realized, that one enemy had a yasou 3. At 3/5 or something. With level 7. After that followed a soraka 3 and a pyke 3. Of course we did not win that round? 

I did some googleing and there seemes to be a cheat to do that? But checking this dudes history, he does it for WEEKS, without beeing baned. (Every third game he gets a three star lvl 5 unit or somethings on these lines...)

TeamfightTactics,"I had an interesting game last night that I thought was hilarious, only tonight it got bested by a lot. I got a huge kick out of running 2 2 star Syfen‚Äôs. One tank one damage with 6 whisper. Propelled me to an easy with with a 3 star Elise with IE, JG, and DC. I don‚Äôt think it comes close to tonight‚Äôs though. 

Tonight I‚Äôve been playing around with Nidalee reroll a bit. I kinda like it because even though getting first isn‚Äôt easy or at all common, she does a great job getting into the top 4. Get a Nid 3 early and you can rebuild your Econ and streak for a while, keeping you healthy for a top 4. 

Well this last game i had 2 star Nidalee and death blade at 2-1, nice start. My first augment was gold and I was like ‚Äúdouble trouble? I‚Äôm definitely going to be 3 starring some stuff and it‚Äôs good so let‚Äôs try it. As expected I streaked hard. At 3-2 I got a prismatic augment also double trouble. Holy shit was it OP. No one really stood a chance any time soon. 

I 3 starred Nid, Vlad, Skar, and Nami. Sold most for extra Econ besides Nid. What‚Äôs funny is my final board which was disgustingly oppressive. For units I had 2 of thats 90 AD, AP, Armor, and MR on shapeshifters with a ton of health. My 2 Nidalees took down a 2 star Idas with Bramble, Dclaw, and Sunfire almost instantly.  I was crushing the lobby. 

My board was Elise 2, Neeko 2, Skarner 3, Neeko 3 with Warmogs, Sunfire, and Gargoyle (like 10k health and unkillable), Gnar 2, Nid 3 with DB, QSS, and RB, Nami 3 with shiv, Nid 2 with GS, Hoj, LW. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have another game this set that‚Äôs more insane and effective. The Nid 3 had like 400AD and Nid 2 250 almost 300., with tons of health and defensive stats. I had like 4 carries because even the naked Neeko 2 was clapping their cheeks. 

The only bummer was my 3rd augment was gold again so I couldn‚Äôt get silver double trouble. I imagine if you have all 3 you practically can‚Äôt lose. That would be 120 AD, AP, MR, and Armor.  I would KILL to see a game with all 3 with Voli 3 carry, Voli 2, Lee 3, Lee 2, Ornn 2, Anivia 2, and a 3rd dragon mancer.

\---

Here is my thoughts on it, not that it matters, but for anyone thats interested.

Yasuo is my usual choice as hes kind of the ""safe carry"" after selling all the other units to hunt his 3\* form.

Pyke.. well I usually go for other 5\* and sell Pykes if I have them on the bench. Hes cool but I enjoy the others more (however cleaning up the board feels so satisfying..)

Zoe I thought is kind of useless compared to the other 5-Cost. Except for the Kayle ult, but that standalone doesnt win the game.

Soraka is funny, I finished on full HP after being last for most of the game.

Bard is just a meme. Once he gets his ult out he just takes the enemy team down one-by-one in slowmotion (if you dont give him AS-Items that is..)

TeamfightTactics,"It used to be that whatever team had the lowest health would go first, then next lowest, etc. 

I understand they changed it because teams could tank their hp early and snag the good items at the first carousel. But they changed the order from 4th/4th, 3rd/3rd, 2nd/2nd, 1st/1st, to 3/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1/2. This eliminates the cheese strategy mentioned earlier where you tank to snag all the good items, but it also heavily punishes teams who naturally lose a lot of health. 

The game is fundamentally built on allowing low hp players to come back from a weak early game. There's no reason a player on a 5 winstreak to start the game should get an item before someone who genuinely could not field a good team before or after krugs and naturally lost 30 hp. It's completely backwards that an already strong team should be rewarded with an early choice from the item carousel. 

I saw this suggestion earlier last month when the set came out, but the order should be switched from what it is currently to a 3/4, 3/4, 1/2, 1/2 order.

TeamfightTactics,"TLDR: save bf swords and reroll dragon treasure for spat for 9 shimmie

So recently I've been playing a lot of games and just forcing shimmer scale and most of the time(~90%)  I end up with the 9 shimmer scale. So throughout the game you can get 7 shimmer scale trait points, so you only need 2 extra. I've found it to be very consistent for someone to get a shimmer scale through a single augment, or spat through carousel aiming for spats and bf swords. This means you only need 1 more spat if didn't get 2 traits already. To get that next spat, just reroll dragon treasure till you get one. And once you get 9 shimmie just place the crown on anything and you should win/maybe place high but most of the time you win.

Lmk your thoughts bc I've only done this a limited amount of times but had quite a lot of success. Another bonus from playing shimmer scale is the extra gold gained, so your able to reroll a lot more times.

TeamfightTactics,"I wanna ask smth though: Are those items resonable for Sy'fen? I thought that if Sy'fen have Mage Emblem and Manazane, it can constantly uses its ability and it did.

TeamfightTactics,,Winning a game against racists idiots eliminating them one by one felt so good
TeamfightTactics,As the title suggests I think that it would be a nice implementation to make the trait more interesting and rewarding to play by giving the player more options and letting em come up with new strategies.,Legend champions should be able to sacrifice other legend champions

TeamfightTactics,"So I only brought the battlepass + a single standalone egg with the excess RP I had left over.

When I got to rank 25 on the battlepass I opened the egg and hit the jackpot.

I've never been so excited to use a Chibi before. I also never expected to hit it.",I only bought the battlepass and got Yasuo! How lucky can I be.
TeamfightTactics,Check out this tft for dummies guide we made. All feedback is appreciated since we're trying to grow!,We've made our very own guide for dummies on TFT.
TeamfightTactics,"When you're playing the same comp as someone else and the game decides to give you an advantage by dropping a spatula in a creep round, that wasn't skill. You simply couldn't know that this is going to happen, no matter how hard you try. It's simply not possible. Even if you say at the beginning ""I know I will have an advantage over this player because the game will drop me a spat"" - it's only an assumption, that's no skill, it's luck.

TeamfightTactics,,"Is this a common bug? All indicators of health bars, items, etc. disappear after I watch Chibi Yasuo execute animation from another player."
TeamfightTactics,"Let's make a unit that cc the entire front row, one shots a unit, can get to the back line, high health, and armor reduction.",syfen literally just shits on the board
TeamfightTactics,"Radiant relics is a really weird augment, not going to lie. On the surface it doesn‚Äôt feel like it should be a prismatic augment at all. You get 1 buffed item which seems kinda lame compared to other augments like living forge. The thing though is that in the right circumstances radiant relics can be almost just straight up broken AF. So I always like to grab it given the chance.

The problem is the last 2 times I picked it up? It bugged out on me and kinda screwed me, first time majorly second time minor and maybe not even a bad thing and maybe it was actually considerable better that way. Regardless it‚Äôs not fun to have bugs. 

First time was a few weeks ago and I was LIVID to say the least. I got Radiant relics at 2-1 so I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably going to win streak‚Äù. Then it never popped up the armory... ok wtf. Whatever it will give me some random item and I‚Äôll build a comp around that. NOPE never got an item even after playing a round. What sucked even more was I couldn‚Äôt even FF because you have to wait until 3-1 or 3-2. I was getting straight stomped (down a prismatic who‚Äôd have guessed). 

Que up the game I just played (weirdest game of all time). I picked up radiant relics and chose death cap instantly. The problem? It wouldn‚Äôt give me the death cap and after like 10 seconds it gave me the radiant Titans... not at all what I wanted and that death cap would have been really nice. 

I‚Äôll explain the game a bit so you know.  I‚Äôve been playing a lot of Elise lately. I feel like she‚Äôs much more reliable than Lee Sin. The goal was IE, JG, and radiant death cap would have worked great (ended up with non radiant death cap). It‚Äôs weird because I think Ez sucks now, but I naturaled Ez 3 by 3-2 with 0 rolling. He won‚Äôt win me the game, but with IE, JG, and radiant Titans he will carry me to the end game with plenty of health no problem. 

I ended up selling him at 5-1 and fully transitioned into Elise. It‚Äôs so unique because I played the stupidest board and still got first. I played Sylas 2 no items, Syfen 2 with gargoyle, spark, sunfire, Thresh 2 holding 2 zekes for Syfen and Elise, Elise 3 with IE, JG, DC. Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúthat‚Äôs  standard put in Neeko+1 and give her the tank items and Syfen damage items. For my last 2 spots I played a second Syfen with IE, BT, and radiant Titans.  The fights weren‚Äôt even close. It sucks the game ended early as I had 8 Syfens, but I was crushing people for 20+ health a round.  Looking back radiant Titans was probably better, but didn‚Äôt help the Elise dream",Radiant relics is killing me!!

TeamfightTactics,,Three Star Soraka may as well be an instant win
TeamfightTactics,"I just played a match where im being contested from the start to the end. 

First I intended to play karma comp, cause it's 2-2 and no one have a single jade champ. Then suddenly two dude had 2 star karma, one with volibear carry and one with good item (bluebuff, jewel) while all I have is some belt and a bow. 

So about 3-2 I tried to transition to xayah guild with cavalier emblem, but again, someone got her already and another also played swiftshot comp. 

After a while, I somehow rolled zoe and Idas so I tried shimmerscale xayah. Sadly, first place person also want Idas for their cannon comp and the last place play mirage cavalier, so I hardly got anything 2 star. 

I managed to craft BIS, but I only got the second xayah before I lost at 8th place.",I hate being contested

TeamfightTactics,"Whats the deal with rolling 70-80g and not getting a 2star champion, even if those champs are not in play?

TeamfightTactics,,forcing 3* syfen is fun.
TeamfightTactics,"With each new set it becomes harder and harder to tell what i am even looking in champion icons. They all start to mesh together, especially when the last few sets being themed. League of Legends only shows default skins in the minimap and scoreboard for a reason. That reason is clarity which TFT lacks. Sure when you put in tons of hours you may have memorized all the icons but that doesn't make it good design. When i look at a menu like this https://i.imgur.com/Rhbfsyc.jpeg all i see purple, blue and orange smears, not champions. An option to see traditional icons like this https://i.imgur.com/q3Jn5Ng.png would go a long way because those are instantly recognizable, especially for LoL players. It also would not affect anyone else since it would be client side. Win Win all around.",TFT could greatly benefit from an option to always display champion default icons for clarity instead of the skin based icons.

TeamfightTactics,"Despite riot saying this set would give more ""player agency"" it's just a bland repetitive set.

I love the concept of TFT, I loved previous sets of TFT. I hate the complacency people have with uncreative sets and the constant ""oh you must not be good"" to anyone who calls them out on it.  


The only challenge is not deviating and dying from boredom by doing the same thing every game. If the game was open source it would take about an hour to write a bot to be Diamond +.",This set is just straight generic blah
